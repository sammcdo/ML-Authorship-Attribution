4,4,215223,1,41,"              Internal Inventory  I don't really know what to tell you.  I spent the evening last night trying to write letters to sort everything out should anything need to be sorted.  Loose ends need to be tied up as much as possible so that those less capable (read, everyone else) won't bungle it.  Also trying to think of painless ways to do painful things with a minimum of cleanup after.  This is probably why more Virgos don't actually kill themselves.  I have a huge collection of things that I love that will mean almost nothing to anyone else, and yet I care where they end up.  Who even remembers 'My One & Only,' much less cares that I saw it about six times and own the propeller that Tommy Tune carried around in it?  Or Sarah Brightman's double mask from 'Phantom?'  Sheryl Lee Ralph's shoes from 'Dreamgirls' might be an easier sell, but probably not B.D. Wong's shoes from 'M. Butterfly'.  What about the model for the set of Cinderella's house from 'Into The Woods,' the mining pick from 'Crazy For You' signed by the entire original cast, my letter from Sondheim, my letter from Katharine Hepburn?  My collected works of the Algonquin Round Table...most of them first editions, many signed.  That Woollcott biography of Mrs. Fiske is damn rare, and how'm I gonna explain that the Jack Baragwanath (who was Neysa's husband) memoir is personally autographed to Robert Sherwood's wife...ugh.  The disposition of this junk is keeping me from swallowing a handful of...of... what?   ...well, that's a whole 'nother issue.  I refuse to jump from something.  I'm not slitting anything.  I don't own a gun, nor do I know anyone who does.  Oh wait, I do, but I'm not talking to him.  Partly 'cause he owns a gun.  As evidenced by the inventory taken of my medicine cabinet, I haven't got a handful of anything that would induce the Sleep of Ages.  I had two aunts that killed themselves.  One, who had Parkinson's and could barely hold a soupspoon, shot herself.  She didn't have to, but she thought she did.  The other was 98 years old and always said that when she got tired of it all, she'd walk all the way to the end of the pier behind her house and jump in the river.  That's where they found her.  Can't really blame either of them.  But, as I said, the gun thing horrifies me and, while drowning seems somehow more palatable, the East River's filthy and out of the question and the Hudson doesn't look like it would do the job.  I mean, I  can  swim.  So what does it mean?  Does it mean I don't have the courage of my convictions?  Possibly.  Does it mean that I'm a big pussy?  Sure, okay.  Does it mean that I want to live.  I don't know.  No.  Yes.  I don't know.  I had a few dreams last night, as you might imagine.  The one I remember the most took place in my apartment.  It didn't look like the apartment I live in now, but it was meant to be in the dream.  I've dreamt of living in that apartment before and always before there were rooms and areas within the apartment that I'd never come across before that dream.  This was no different.  In this dream I first noticed that my apartment was empty.  Then I noticed that the service entrance (which actually looked like the service entrance in my real apartment) was open and some of my belongings were stacked there.  I panicked and went back inside to see what was missing...nothing seemed to be.  I then wandered into the back service hallway and saw through a hallway that doesn't really exist, some neighbors I'd never seen before.  One looked cute and was wearing briefs.  I thought I'd get a better look if I went to the window in the back bedroom.  I walked through the apartment to a room I had forgotten even existed.  It wasn't really big enough to be a bedroom, but it was slightly elevated and had windows all the way across the back wall.  Then I realized that they weren't just windows, but sliding doors.  How had I never noticed that?  I stepped up into that room, slid the door open and stepped onto a small terrace I also hadn't known was there.  The sun hit this terrace through some trees and it was so warming and pleasant that I stood there for a few minutes soaking up the heat.  Then I looked around.  Apparently in all the time I'd forgotten to check this back room, they'd built a pool.  Full-size, in-ground pool.  And all the apartments on my floor opened onto this pool area, which was white stucco, with pale brick accents.  And flooded with light.  The neighbor I had seen before was swimming in it, and others were gardening on their terraces, etc.  I thought to myself, 'I can't believe I'm leaving here now that there's this beautiful warm terrace and a pool to enjoy, especially just as summer's starting.'  I also remember wondering how long it had been there, and that I could've been enjoying it all this time.  None of my neighbors seemed surprised to see me, although I didn't recognize any of them.  I remember starting down the stairs from my terrace towards the pool to check the water, and then I don't remember anything else.  Closer to dawn, I remember being half awake while this rapid-fire slide show went off in my head.  So fast that not a single image remains.  It was disorienting in it's speed and also in the fact that each image contained some full emotion that hit me fully but moved on with the next image/feeling.  I don't remember any of it specifically, just that it happened.  I couldn't get my ass out of bed this morning.  My angelic puffin (who's real name is Dexter and who said to me in a dream several nights ago that he didn't like the pseudonym 'Rex' because it made him sound common and he didn't need his anonymity protected) stood worried guard over me until I managed to sit up.  We took a short walk, I made us breakfast, I packed some books, I sat on the sofa and cried.  Finally, I made the call I'd been dreading.  I called the landlord to tell him that, even though I'd promised to get him this money by the end of the month, I just didn't have it.  I said I could send him a check for $800 and I'd work on getting him the rest as soon as I could, but I honestly didn't know when or how fast that would be.  Do you know what he said to me?  He said, 'You've sent in money when you told me you would, and I consider you a man of your word.  So I'll work with you on this.'  A man of my word.  Me?  I don't know what to do with this information.  And this from a man who very recently made me feel that my absence would be worth far more than my presence.  Is he fucking with me?  I got email today from a bunch of people, many of them bloggers, almost all of them people I've never met.  They all said different-but-similar things: that I had value.  These are all people I consider to be interesting, accomplished, intelligent...at least in their writing and in the information they've chosen to put out into the world.  Man, I thought to myself, I've pulled some major wool over an internet full of eyes.  I have value?  I don't know what to do with that information, either.  Jesus H., I just got off the phone.  It was JSquared.  Through him, the Universe has decided to pluck me up by the scruff of my neck and toss me into the second weirdest place I could be this weekend:  'I have an extra ticket to the Tonys and the Rocky Horror Tony party after.'  What.  The.  Fuck?  Now 'Happy Couple Party' doesn't sound so bad.  Nooooo, now my option is put on a fake Prada suit that I'll feel fat in and enter the belly of the Showtune Singin' Beast.  I really don't know what to do with this information.  It's not like anyone's gonna say 'what the hell are you doing here?'  I actually think people assume I go to these things all the time.  But what if they ask 'what are you in now?'  Or even, 'how are you?'  I'm petrified of these questions.  Last night I thought I was done.  This morning, too.  I still thought so at the beginning of this entry.  But it looks like, for the moment at least, I have to throw in the towel on throwing in the towel.  I really don't understand it.  I wish I had some sort of perspective or could just get a peek at the schematic.  Something, anything...'cause I just don't understand it.  It's easy to say, 'let go and see where the current takes you,' but it's not such an easy thing to do.  It's not something that makes sense to me.  Faith?  As if.  But given the fact that, strong desire aside, I seem ill-prepared to jump ship at the moment, and the fact that I'm being tossed all manner of weird life preservers, I suppose I might as well just 'ride it out, girlfriend.'  Y'know, I was telling RJ the other night that, no matter how bad the movie or play or book, I always stick it out to the end.  Don't know why.  Maybe it's stubbornness or strong curiosity...and sometimes it's been rewarded.  I guess I should afford my so-called life the same courtesy.

12,12,215223,1,41,"              But If You Try Sometimes, You Just Might Find...  So after ladling out my sage advice like so much  urlLink chilled cucumber mint soup  at a Martha Stewart summer dinner, I finally served myself a big bowl of it and went to the West Side Club last night.  I'd been whining about wanting attention and needing to be touched and so I just shut up and did something about it.  And, oddly enough, it didn't turn out so bad.  After work I shaved, showered, trimmed the topiary, added a little hair product but did not add deodorant and headed for the R train.  But instead of getting out at 23rd Street, I got off at 34th Street to take myself for a walk and give myself a stern talking-to before arrival.  Basically I reminded myself of the cucumber, er,  urlLink advice  I gave Tinman about the place.  It's good to be prepared.  It turns out that eating well and exercising have paid off.  Soon after checking into lovely Room 228, I became quite popular.  Most of these would-be suitors didn't suit me, but I made a huge point of turning them down in the least derisive, friendliest, 'so kind of you to offer' voice and facial demeanor.  It's just good tubs karma, I think.  There were even a couple of guys I turned down that, after they'd left my doorway, I thought to myself, 'Are you crazy?  He was SO out of your league and you turned him down?'  But it just wasn't what I was looking for.  What I was looking for was some kind of chemistry.  Some form of being appreciated for who and what I am, even though it would mostly be on the most superficial levels.  And the fact is, with some Monster Hot Guy I'd be trying to be something else and spending a little too much time fearing the ultimate rejection, which feelings necessarily feuling the ultimate rejection.  Another time for Monster Hot, that trolley occasionally stops at my door and I can hop on when I'm feeling saucier.  Maybe I've thought too much about it all, or maybe my instincts in this are excellent, but what I wanted was to see myself flashed in someone's eyes instantly in the same way they did in mine.  While the Monster Hot Brigade  liked  me, there was a little sizing up before the decision was made.  I had no time for sizing up, I needed gut reaction (Jesus, gut reaction in the eyes...please, Blogdom, bring your metaphors to me...let me mix 'em just the way you like 'em).  I knew there was an outside chance that I wouldn't find that, but there would be plenty of time for settling if need be.  That time came quickly.  I grew impatient.  I played briefly with a guy who was sexy but wasn't connecting entirely.  And he wouldn't kiss.  Daddy needs to be kissed.   Next !  Then I fooled around with a guy I had eyed around town for awhile who was fun, but not quite it.  He did bring an offering, however, and after removing all traces of powder residue from his key, I was wide awake and ready for chemistry.  I decided a shower would be a nice, soothing activity to cleanse the palate (and whatever else needed cleansing).  The water not only felt great but I wasn't the least bit self-conscious showering out in the open (and, really, these showers are like Your Grocers' Freezer...everyone comes by to do their browsing and they ain't subtle about it).  And towelling off it happened.  The eyes, the sparks, the tingle.  He was moving out of the locker room and I was moving toward the sauna to dry off a bit more, but I figured, hey, let him get ahead a little...it'll give him the illusion of being chased.  Mistake!  It actually took a good 15 - 20 minutes to find him again, but when we both turned the corner and saw each other we were focused on each other's eyes and our hands found nipples and shoulders and things.  He did something rare then, he introduced himself.  Names, as you might imagine, are not always exchanged at the West Side Club.  He offered his right up (Richard) and wanted to know mine.  Cool.  Definitely interested.  We proceeded to the recessed lighting and percale sheets of Room 228.  This was exactly what I'd come for.  Great kisser, attentive, creative, into me as much as I was into him, not in a rush, no script.  And the Brain Additive (which Richard offered me a bit more of later) was working its wonders.  It was also blurring the lines a little.  Not that I need drugs to do that, mind you, but they do give you something better to blame than human frailty.  You see, besides just enjoying Richard's body and attention, I started to fantasize a little about Richard's future.  I'd think to myself, 'He's well-spoken...at least I could introduce him to my friends.'  And then, 'I bet we look kinda hot together...that would look good on Eighth Avenue.'  I'd have moments where I felt indescribable tenderness for this stranger.  Or think, 'I wonder if we'll laugh about meeting here.'  Now, before the serious eye-rolling starts, tell me you don't do that.  Just a little.  It's the nature of good chemistry.  As humans we want to extend those good, connected feelings.  Even when it's just sex with a stranger.  Just for a fraction of a night, you fall in love with that person.  His touch or his mouth, his eyes or the way he holds you or lets you hold him.  And, oh man, I did.  It was wonderful.  I let myself float a little on that cloud and it did me a world of good.  Because it allowed me to allow a living, breathing man into my very personal space, not caring about how much rent I owe or how much dog hair there is under my bed.  It allowed be to be appreciated solely for the man I was at  that moment , appreciated for the pleasure I was bringing and to receive pleasure in return.  To hold onto a stranger so tight that it  should  hurt but does only the reverse.  I was wildly in love with Richard for a night, and he was in love with me.  We were together for a couple of hours, switching rooms and taking shower and pee breaks.  It was never less than mutually satisfying and fun.  I think the degree to which the chemistry flowed surprised and delighted us both.  He asked for my number and I gave it to him (but I don't really expect to hear from him).  We talked about maybe leaving together and going to one of our apartments to continue, but the logistics didn't really work out.  So we parted.  And I was okay with it.  Whenever we'd pass each other in the hallway or by one of our rooms, it was like we were co-conspirators.  Or very sophisticated lovers.  We'd chat a bit, or duck into a room and makeout or something.  At one point, Richard introduced me to someone he'd been talking to.  'Charlie, this is David.  David has a twelve-inch dick.'  I chuckled a little, while Richard quietly assessed my interest in David and whether he might join us for a romp.  I wasn't all that interested in David, so I just said, 'I'm gonna take a little stroll.  I'll stop by in a bit and you can tell me if David's telling the truth.'  He was happy, I was happy, and, knowing how talented Richard is, I have no doubt that David was happy.  It didn't hit me in my self-esteem, I didn't feel jilted (as ridiculous as the thought of that might sound), and I still felt connected.  In whatever superficial way (although I'd give you an argument on just how superficial), my needs had been met, my emotional wells had been filled, and I was comfortable.  Everything's in the same place as yesterday:  all the bills, all the decisions, all the worry.  But last night I was held tightly and kissed properly by someone who cared about me while he was doing it.  I fell a little bit in love.  And I'm calmer for it today.  Now I ask you: is that so wrong?

15,15,215223,1,41,"              Revenge of the B-List  I wish you could've seen my face when I opened it.  Actually, I wish  I  could've seen my face.  And, most importantly, I wish I could've seen Blaine's face.  I recognized the return address on the envelope and, the truth is, I almost tossed it.  I mean, another glossy 'invite' featuring a different-but-same glossy muscle boy wearing a different-but-same glossy g-string beckoning us to a different-but-same glossy Saturday night dance party that anyone who's going dancing is already going to anyway.  Why bother?  But the shape of it was different and my curiousity got the better of me.  In retrospect, I'm glad it did.  I wonder, was Pandora just a little bit glad, too?  I ran to the phone and called Blaine at his office, hoping he wasn't on one of his non-smoking breaks.  He wasn't.  'Blaine Hargadon,' he answered in his butch phone voice.   'Hey missy,' I said. 'Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!' he responded, his voice soaring an octave.  Blaine can go from Manly to Mary in 0.3 seconds. 'Are you sitting down?' I asked, and I blurted my news.   'How did   you   get one?' he screeched.  I knew what he meant, actually agreed in a way, but it still made me a little huffy.   'Maybe they finally ran out of A-List, dear.  Or perhaps I'm part of some sort of cultural exchange program, like the Fresh Air Fund.  I know, maybe they're bussing in queers who don't have trust funds but do have fat cells as an anthropological experiment.' 'Oh relax.  It's just that, I, uh, I mean...don't you think it's odd that you'd get a Gold Card out of the blue?' 'What you really mean is, don't I think it's odd that I got a Gold Card and you didn't?' 'Of course that's what I mean!' 'Clearly there's been some hideous mistake and the minute I present it at the door I'll be wrestled to the ground by a couple of testosterclones in hazmat gear.  But until that happens, I think we're gonna get to swim in the shallow end of the pool for a change...'  Now, don't get me wrong: I'd love to be in with the in-crowd.  Who wouldn't?  We're all basically recovering from high school.  We  all  wanna be popular.  We  all  wanna sit at the cool table in the cafeteria.  We  all  wanna get chatted up by the elite between classes.  Especially fags.  We spent a lot of our time back then either trying to be invisible in the hallways so we wouldn't get beat up or counseling cheerleaders on whether or not to go all the way (I always voted for yes).  So when those of us who grow up and move away to a gay mecca finally realize it's high school all over again, we do our damndest not to fall back into that same pattern.  We reinvent.  We workout.   We buy hair product and good shoes.  We become hyper-aware of our selves and our surroundings all the time in order to create the best impression.  And, in many cases,  we relinquish most of the things that make us  interesting  in order to be  popular .  Some of the time it actually works.  I'm living proof that one can improve one's gay station in life (I've even maintained most of my personality).  But the sad fact is, if you're not inately A-List, you probably never will be.  Unless you come into a great deal of money, or win a Tony or something, that wall just can't be scaled.  Even marrying in doesn't guarantee you a permanent spot, 'cause the minute that marriage is over so's your identity (unless part of your settlement includes the house in the Pines).  But a Gold Card.   Well .  It was like opening a Wonka Bar and finding the golden ticket.  In the last reel you may not walk away with factory, but you definitely get to go inside and have a good look at it.  Maybe even touch an Oompah-Loompah.  And now I had one.  Go figure.  Two years ago I was in a passionless relationship, 50 pounds heavier, with a bad haircut and a mild form of gay agoraphobia.  Thanks to Blaine, I'd started going back to the gym for more than a sneak peek in the showers, discovered that it made me feel good about myself, shed the pounds and most of the hair, and for the first time in five years bought clothes that didn't use color and large buttons to divert attention from my body.  I'd even allowed Blaine and Alex to take me dancing at the Palladium, and I allowed myself to actually enjoy it.  The music was great, the three of us laughed and ogled boys, and I came back to life.  Or rather, came to a new life, one I couldn't have imagined before or during Peter.  A life of fun, good friends and where I actually liked myself.  Pursuing my own happiness.  Perhaps this Gold Card nonsense was just the Universe signalling to me that I was on the right path, a reward for taking care of myself, a signpost of even better things to come.  Mostly likely, though, it was a clerical error.  Didn't matter, I was ready to take this baby out for a spin.  I guess you're wondering what all the fuss is about, huh?  If you are, that probably means you have a sensible life, probably outside of one of the Big Gay Towns, and more than likely you know what 'escrow' means.  New York City is a different animal.  You, The People, live your lives in homes with yards.  We, the Urban Gays, live our lives in public: bars, clubs, coffeehouses, the Runway Known As Eighth Avenue, the gym.  I know it sounds shallow, but it really...oh hell, of course it is.  A little.  But it's also fun, as long as you keep your sense of humor and don't give your life over to it.  I think they call it  balance .  But when going out becomes a career, when you're on the guestlist, when you can discuss the finer performance points of DJs and have slept with at least three, when your picture is splashed across the back pages of HomoXtra, when you spend a whole day picking out a $250 shirt that you'll deposit in coat check the minute you get in the club, when you can calculate in your head the distance of a particular trick on Eighth Avenue, figure in his body fat percentage times his potential for getting you a discount at Barney's, multiply it by who you're with, divide it by who he's with, also factoring in who's in his house on the Island and come up with the appropriate greeting (in this case, the Moving Air Kiss), then you're probably A-List.  And one of the biggest accoutrement of the A-List is the Gold Card, bestowed by our city's most prominent party promoter, Jack Flair.  The lucky bearer of the Gold Card waits not in line, nay, nor any of his posse.  He pays not to enter clubs (said posse only gets a discount).  All manner of libation are discounted.  Just a flash of the Gold can make a fellow faggot turn Green.    I know, I know...it doesn't sound like much.  And it's not.  A Gold Card can't heal the lame.  It can't turn loaves and fishes into a high-protein, low-carb meal for a hundred.  It can't turn baby aspirin into Ecstasy.  It has no power unless you  believe  it does.  But boy, do  They  believe.   They  have a goodly portion of the population convinced, too.  Jack Flair has hypnotized Gay Cafe Society into believing that to possess a Gold Card is to possess true enlightenment and inner (not to mention outer) beauty.  Of course, if you have a White Card, you can certainly wait in line, pay your cash and dance around, yes quite near, to the Gold Cards.  Maybe even catch their eye or over hear a snippet of their conversation.  Anybody can get a White Card.  They all but foist them on you.  Ordinarily  I'm  a White Card.  That was  then , this is now.

Blaine's face I recognized the return address on the envelope and the truth is I almost tossed it I mean another glossy invite featuring a different-but-same glossy muscle boy wearing a different-but-same glossy g-string beckoning us to a different-but-same glossy Saturday night dance party that anyone who's going dancing is already going to anyway Why bother But the shape of it was different and my curiousity got the better of me In retrospect I'm glad it did I wonder was Pandora just a little bit glad too I ran to the phone and called Blaine at his office hoping he wasn't on one of his non-smoking breaks He wasn't Blaine Hargadon he answered in his butch phone voice Hey missy I said Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii he responded his voice soaring an octave Blaine can go from Manly to Mary in seconds Are you sitting down I asked and I blurted my news How did you get one he screeched I knew what he meant actually agreed in a way but it still made me a little huffy Maybe they finally ran out of A-List dear Or perhaps I'm part of some sort of cultural exchange program like the Fresh Air Fund I know maybe they're bussing in queers who don't have trust funds but do have fat cells as an anthropological experiment Oh relax It's just that I uh I mean...don't you think it's odd that you'd get a Gold Card out of the blue What you really mean is don't I think it's odd that I got a Gold Card and you didn't Of course that's what I mean Clearly there's been some hideous mistake and the minute I present it at the door I'll be wrestled to the ground by a couple of testosterclones in hazmat gear But until that happens I think we're gonna get to swim in the shallow end of the pool for a change Now don't get me wrong I'd love to be in with the in-crowd Who wouldn't We're all basically recovering from high school We all wanna be popular We all wanna sit at the cool table in the cafeteria We all wanna get chatted up by the elite between classes Especially fags We spent a lot of our time back then either trying to be invisible in the hallways so we wouldn't get beat up or counseling cheerleaders on whether or not to go all the way I always voted for yes So when those of us who grow up and move away to a gay mecca finally realize it's high school all over again we do our damndest not to fall back into that same pattern We reinvent We workout We buy hair product and good shoes We become hyper-aware of our selves and our surroundings all the time in order to create the best impression And in many cases we relinquish most of the things that make us interesting in order to be popular Some of the time it actually works I'm living proof that one can improve one's gay station in life I've even maintained most of my personality But the sad fact is if you're not inately A-List you probably never will be Unless you come into a great deal of money or win a Tony or something that wall just can't be scaled Even marrying in doesn't guarantee you a permanent spot cause the minute that marriage is over so's your identity unless part of your settlement includes the house in the Pines But a Gold Card Well It was like opening a Wonka Bar and finding the golden ticket In the last reel you may not walk away with factory but you definitely get to go inside and have a good look at it Maybe even touch an Oompah-Loompah And now I had one Go figure Two years ago I was in a passionless relationship pounds heavier with a bad haircut and a mild form of gay agoraphobia Thanks to Blaine I'd started going back to the gym for more than a sneak peek in the showers discovered that it made me feel good about myself shed the pounds and most of the hair and for the first time in five years bought clothes that didn't use color and large buttons to divert attention from my body I'd even allowed Blaine and Alex to take me dancing at the Palladium and I allowed myself to actually enjoy it The music was great the three of us laughed and ogled boys and I came back to life Or rather came to a new life one I couldn't have imagined before or during Peter A life of fun good friends and where I actually liked myself Pursuing my own happiness Perhaps this Gold Card nonsense was just the Universe signalling to me that I was on the right path a reward for taking care of myself a signpost of even better things to come Mostly likely though it was a clerical error

16,16,215223,1,41,"              Gay As A Parade!  I am gay.  Not just gay, I'm a perfect  urlLink Kinsey 6 . I've always been gay and I've always known it, even though I didn't always have a name for it and, for awhile during adolescence, tried fervently to believe that it was just a phase.  When I hear stories about guys who didn't even know they had homosexual inclinations until their twenties, I'm baffled.  In nursery school I used to get this teensy weensy hardons (they grown since then) and I'd always run and find Danny Hall on the playground and hug him and press it against him (his response was always 'quit lovin' on me' -- my guess is Danny probably has to say that often now to his cellmates)  I've never had a girlfriend, been on a real date with a woman, and I've absolutely never had sex with a woman.  I did kiss Jan Orlosky once at a pool party in junior high school (no tongue), but she turned out to be a dyke anyway, so I don't think that counts (besides, I used to fool around with her brother).  And don't start that 'fags hate women' thing, 'cause I think women are fantastic, but I prefer the company of men.  Watching the parade this afternoon was thought provoking, but mostly unemotional.  Let's face it:  I've seen it all and then some.  Two things caused a catch in my throat today, one expected and one not.  The expected was, of course, the two o'clock Moment of Silence.  This raucous parade with it's bar floats blaring club anthems, Cyndi Lauper on top of a fire truck belting out her new songs, gospel choirs, the Gay Men's Chorus, marching bands...all of it stops completely at two o'clock to remember all those men and women in our lives who didn't make it to this parade.  I thought about my friend Ric, who taught me about Fosse and All About Eve; Danny, who tried to teach me, by example, not to care what the hell anyone else thinks; Tommy, who was completely insane and spastic, and a terrible actor, but would do anything,  anything  to be in the theatre; Hal, one of my first teachers in New York who cried once in class when I did a song that touched him; and, of course, my sweet  urlLink Mac .  The unexpected was just a simple tshirt, worn by a PFLAG mother marching with her son, and handwritten on the back, probably in Magic Marker, was 'I'm proud to be Tom's mother!'  Call me a sap, but nobody ever said they were proud to by  my  mother, much less marched in a parade and wore the tshirt.  Made me think, hell, if I knew as early as I did -- and I don't ever remember not knowing, when I was sexually harassing Danny Hall, I was about 4 -- my mother  had  to know.  Right?  Then again, that would've meant acknowledging my existence in some way, so maybe not.  But I'm not objective, so you decide.  Ladies and Gentlemen, for Your Blog Consumption Pleasure, I Wish to Present, in a Vaguely Chronological Order, as Many Childhood Incidents of My Nascent Homosexuality (and Future Fabulosity) as I Can Recall (otherwise entitled: 'Ring, Ring...Mother It's The Cluephone For You').     In nursery and kindergarten, whenever we played Lost In Space, I was always Dr. Smith.   In my School Days Memories book that goes year by year, the section entitled 'What I Want To Be' has several pre-printed answers (Fireman, Astronaut, Cowboy, etc.).  These are all crossed out and in tense cursive my mother has written in 'Movie Star.'   In first grade I didn't have a crush on Dee Dee Cox, I just wanted to run like her.  My mother caught sight of me running with my hands up and prissy and nearly had a coronary (note to self:  do you think this would work today?).   Also in first grade, we present a sock puppet performance of 'Hansel and Gretel.'  I am the Witch (a character actress even then).  When constructing the sock puppet, I insist my mother use the purply-blue swirly fabric, because 'no witch would be caught dead in brown.'   My first parakeet I named 'Pretty Boy.'   In the first attempts to purchase for me the man-making bats, balls, gloves, etc., a  urlLink G.I. Joe  was purchased.  I adored him.  You pulled his dogtags and he said:  G.I. Joe, Ready For Action, Sir!'  [This is all that I'm trying to say...]   Speaking of action figures, I was also purchased some other masculine-character-building dolls:   urlLink Big Jim and Big Jeff .  They both arrived shirtless and well-defined (Jim could even pop a steel band of his arm when he flexed his bicep).  They didn't seem to have girlfriends, but they did own jointly a camper, a jet, and a racecar.  I used to wish I could become their size so I could go camping with them...be careful what you wish for...   When the Cub Scouts announced we were doing a talent show, I came up with a high-concept idea where I would be all three of the Andrews Sisters, lip-synching to my mother's old 78s, and wearing one of her altered Hattie Carnegie suits.  She seemed doubtful, so I surprised her by performing the entire thing, costume, wig and all, in the living room one night.     Every night in order to go to sleep, I had to stack as many cast albums as my record player could stand (when one finished playing, the next LP would drop), and I would fall asleep listening to My Fair Lady, The King & I, Oklahoma!, Carousel, 1776, Hello Dolly!, etc.   I loved ' urlLink Funny Lady .'  Let me repeat that:  Not ' urlLink Funny Girl ,' ' urlLink Funny Lady .'   I could then, and can still now, perform all of the songs and many of the scenes of the aforementioned 'Funny Lady.'  ('For once I didn't say too much, I didn't say too little, I said just enough and then I walked.')   For my mother's birthday one year, I redecorated her bathroom.   This is an ugly one, but:  Once on my grandfather's farm in Virginia, I had been helping pick potatoes (I was probably around 9 or 10).  I got tired eventually and went inside, where my father announced to the entire household that I couldn't do the work because I was 'sissified.'  My first thought wasn't, 'hey, that's mean' it was 'how did he know?'   Sophomore year in high school, I cajoled my mother into having my allergist write a note to my coach so I could be excused from Phys. Ed. all together, thus sparing me the embarrassment of being a skinny, weak, uncoordinated kid in a locker room full of jocks.  Instead, I was put in an alternate class with the school's three pregnant black girls and an asthmatic Korean, and we watched tv and learned to disco dance (even several months pregnant they helped me to perfect my bump-touchdown-turnaround-bump).   Just the fact that I  had  an allergist...   I regularly wore a pair of vintage tuxedo tails and a bowler hat to school.   I regularly wore a vintage smoking jacket at home (burgundy silk...heaven!). I could go on and on (as though I hadn't already).  However, just reading these few facts skimmed from only the surface of my memory, you can see that I  Was  most definitely what I  Was  and Some Menopausal Someone was in deep denial.  But I knew.  It's funny to me now, when guys remark on my 'butchness,' or even -- and this has happened several times and it never ceases to startle me -- when I'm assumed to be straight, to think back on that underweight, pale, oversized-bespectacled, clumsy, sassified, sissified, allergic, showtune-lovin' and, yes, nelly little boy.  Because that's still who I am.  I don't think I consciously created this persona to cover the other, what I think (hope) happened is that I used it all and raised  myself  to be a man.  A gay man.  A man who's got 17' biceps and all the lyrics to 'Funny Lady' in his heart.

19,19,215223,1,41,"              Mommie Vaguest  Mother's Day, huh?  Sorry -- don't get it.  Of course, that might be 'cause I haven't spoken to my mine in a few years.  Mother, that is.  It's not really a big deal, I just finally got up-to-speed on our relationship.  Turns out it's like one of those ' urlLink Magic Eye ' pictures.  I stared at it and stared at it for years, thinking I knew what it was, other people told me what  they  thought it was, but I  still  didn't see it, then one day it came into focus, I saw exactly what it is and now I can't  not  see it.  She had me when she was 40.  At the time she had a philandering, probably alcoholic husband and nearly-invalid mother to take care of as well.  But, as I so helpfully and appropriately announced at Christmas Eve dinner once, if I'm such a goddamned burden, why didn't she just have an abortion?  It's a good question.  But if she had,  you'd probably be having to play Mah Johngg at  urlLink Iwin  instead of reading this fascinating blog.  At any rate, I think she probably felt incredibly put-upon, with very few options.  I feel for her, but I feel more for the baby, who had fewer options.  She had been a party girl (see I come by it honestly) who's life went horribly traditional at some point.  Sorry, lady.  What's even more fucked up, and I'll have to really look into this sometime, is why  I  chose  her .  The point is, I arrived, they divorced, her mother died, and there we were, just the two of us.  Shoulda brought us closer together, huh?  Let's look and see:  She worked as a secretary, 8 to 5 every day, so as soon as she could go back to work, I went to a sitter all day.  Once I was old enough for pre-school (3 years old), I was there all day with day care until she could pick me up after work.  Then I became a latch key child, coming home to an empty house every day after school until she came home.  And after 5:30 or 6pm when she was home?  Well, we never ate a meal together at the dinner table...ever.  For a long time, most of our meals were delivered by a service she paid for, so she didn't have to cook when she got home.  Fair enough, but I was eating someone else's food at a table for one in front of the television at 8 years old.  No 'how was your day' or 'what did you learn.'  No 'who are your friends' or 'do you have any homework.'  For that matter, no 'want me to read you a story?' or 'should I lay down with you until you're not afraid anymore?' or 'give me a hug.'  Especially the last one.  A story I really enjoy telling therapists, is the one where I come into the kitchen (I had to be small because I remember my head not coming quite up to the counter top), running up to my mother who's washing dishes and give her a big hug from behind, to which she says, without even looking down, 'not now, honey, it's too hot for that.'  Well, it  was  Florida.  Thank Goddess for the Theatre.  And for other people's perceptive mothers.  Oh sure, she did drive me to rehearsals, but that meant also guaranteed I'd be out for awhile.  Other people's mothers noticed me, liked me, acknowledged my intelligence and creativity.  Got me IQ tests.  Got me into Gifted Child Ed. programs.  Had me over for the weekend.  I remember once Mrs. Orlosky, the mother of a couple of friends from theatre --kids, by the way, that I hadn't seen for a couple of years at the time of this incident-- stopped by my house out of the blue with an entire collection of J.D. Salinger paperbacks, just because she thought I needed to read them.  Thanks Mrs. Orlosky, Happy Mothers' Day to you.  I'm not saying my mother's an ogre.  She's probably a really nice person.  She just has no interest in me.  Barely came to see me in shows.  Never told me I was good in 'em or not.  Actually, never mentioned me at all.  I didn't even realized I was missing that, until one summer in stock, years later, I learned my friend David's mother had a sort of shrine to him in her house:  articles, pictures, reviews...the whole thing.  I commented at dinner that night about this goofy shrine and, it turns out, it's what normal, proud parents do.  Normal parents make their kids feel great just for existing; normal parents celebrate the special things their kids do.  Oh.  Wait, I can sorta see those pixels forming...is it a sailboat?  A pony?  A few years I was hired to sing on a cd, my first major recording project, and when it was done I sent my mother a copy.  She confirmed she got it, that's the last I've heard about it.  A year or so after that, I mounted my own, farily successful cabaret show in Manhattan.  Surprisingly, she decided to come up to see it.  This was perfect:   just me singing and goofing off for an hour or so.  I made sure my friend moved her over by the door as soon as the show was over, so she'd not only overhear what other people said about me on their way out, but what they said  to  me.  I was overwhelmed.  Friends, acquaintences, strangers all loved my material, my voice, my energy.  I noticed my mother chatting to someone off to the side...about azaleas.  At dinner after she never mentioned a thing about me or the show.  During the next two days of her visit, while I learned things about her and about my own life that I'd never known (like, for instance, where she and my father met and how long they were really married), she never talked about my show, the alleged reason for her coming up.  On the last night she was in town, I finally, blatantly asked, 'so what are you gonna tell everyone at home your favorite show in New York was?'  To which she replied, 'The Scarlet Pimpernel?'  'Ummm...no.'  '1776?'  'No, mother.'  'Then what?  I didn't see anything else.'  More pixels...is it a clown?  Elvis?  Even with all that information, still I pretended we had a relationship.  Even with the 8-track of her greatest hits in my head ('you'll never be any good with money,' 'why don't you get a real job to fall back on?' and 'you never take the time to do anything right') I wasn't exactly getting it.  I know that, if you've had  that  conversation with your mother but she keeps forgetting you're gay there's something not connecting, but, no,  I couldn't be right because I never take the time to do  anything  right.  What was the breaking point?  Probably something about finances, our very last connection (she's had a rich, full life, I want my money now).  Maybe it was the fact that she didn't know the name or any of the details of the Off-Broadway show I'd been in for a year.  Whatever it was, the light bulb came on, the light shifted, or maybe nothing changed at all.  But I could see the Magic Eye in full focus.  It was a picture of my relationship with my mother.  And I was the only one in it.  Mother's Day.  I guess I've been mothered (and fathered) by a lot of people throughout the years, non-traditionally and surprisingly so, but I'm a big boy now and I'll take over whatever parenting needs to be done from here on out.

perfect just me singing and goofing off for an hour or so I made sure my friend moved her over by the door as soon as the show was over so she'd not only overhear what other people said about me on their way out but what they said to me I was overwhelmed Friends acquaintences strangers all loved my material my voice my energy I noticed my mother chatting to someone off to the side...about azaleas At dinner after she never mentioned a thing about me or the show During the next two days of her visit while I learned things about her and about my own life that I'd never known like for instance where she and my father met and how long they were really married she never talked about my show the alleged reason for her,91,test
26,26,215223,1,41,"              Doing What We Can  I just got back from downtown.  Jon Jordan and I made about 50 sandwiches of all kinds.  It was almost an impossible task since no grocery store in midtown has bread.  No bread.  We don't know if it's because people are stocking up at home or if everyone was making sandwiches, but not a single loaf of any kind of bread on any shelf in any grocery store in midtown.  All I'm saying is, whoever ends up with the sandwiches that Jon Jordan and I made got top quality rolls and designer bread.  But then, they deserve it.  I grabbed my big bag of clothes, and we headed to the Javits Center.  First stop, drop off my used clothes.  I actually expected them to take them and toss them to the side.  Far from it.  They asked what I had and they ripped into the bag immediately, yelling the contents and sorting them into boxes that quickly got moved to trucks.  I can't tell you how pleased I was that my clothes were going to be of help right away.   That done, we walked over to the river to walk down to Chelsea Piers.  Chelsea Piers has been set up as a triage center.  As we walked down, we could see that the most recent building collapses had sent more dust and smoke into the air and the wind was now moving some of that smoke uptown.  The core of the smoke remained over lower Manhattan, though.  On the walk down, we passed a lot of military personnel guarding building and street entrances, all heavily armed.  Chilling to think all those rifles and machine guns were loaded.  When we got to the Piers we learned that they were overloaded with food and water and volunteers, but they told us that supplies were desperately needed downtown, mostly at a fire station at Varrick and North Moore Streets.  So we started walking down.  Chelsea Piers is at 23rd Street and the Hudson.  North Moore Street is in Tribeca (the TRIangle BElow CAnal Street...i.e., waaaay downtown).  We would've taken a cab, but there haven't been too many.  Plus, no cab would be allowed below 14th Street, where the City's been sealed off.  We weren't sure we'd be allowed through, since we didn't have any identification showing we belonged there,  but we hoped our food credentials would get us past.  All along 14th Street there are blue police barricades set up.  We approached an officer, told him our story, he checked our drivers' licenses and looked through our bags and let us by.  We were in the Forbidden Zone.  Far fewer people, far fewer cars.  More restaurants open, and many, many more handwritten signs.  Signs directing people to blood banks, signs announcing prayer vigils, signs asking for donations of tshirts, toothbrushes, etc. for workers who haven't been home in 24 hours.  There's a distinct burning smell down there and the dust in the air began to get very thick.  A lot of people were wearing surgical masks or other types of homemade masks to keep the dust and, we now know, asbestos particles, out of their mouths.  We walked with our shirts over our mouths for a bit, but it got to be too much.  I'm still coughing a bit and my eyes are sore.  We walked down Hudson as far as we could, I guess it was about Vandaam, and we were redirected to Varrick Street.  At Varrick we told the officer where we had been sent by Chelsea Piers and they told us we'd need to go to Pier 40 to drop off our supplies.  I have to say, New York's Finest were nothing but.  And as exasperated as I'd normally be, I wasn't bothered.  We had something that we needed to do and we'd go wherever we needed to, to do it.  The closer we got to the West Side Highway, the more people there were.  The highway was lined with people some with flags, some just watching.  But the minute a fleet of rescue workers came rolling by everyone on the sidelines errupted into applause and cheers.  Some rushed out to the cars with bottles of water and sandwiches and energy bars.  The workers in the trucks looked so tired and sad, but grateful for our cheers.  I'll never forget how proud I was to be a New Yorker, standing there supporting those people who've been literally sifting through this nightmare.  We crossed the highway over to Pier 40 where another distribution and volunteer center has been set up.  We couldn't get too close, more barricades, but one rescue worker with a Parks Department shirt on, came out and took our bags and was very thankful.  We don't know who'll end up with our food, but I hope they know that two little guys in midtown are grateful for what they're doing.  After dropping off our bags, Jon was tired.  We had, after all walked over 50 blocks.  I wasn't ready to go home yet, so I put him in a cab and told him I'd call him later.  I started walking uptown.  I wanted to go to Chelsea and see what my people were doing.  Earlier, our mayor had said we should all go outside, try to resume our lives, eat in restaurants, shop.  He didn't have to tell Chelsea twice.  But it was different, dampened.  And there was a spontaneous sidewalk vigil.  All along Eighth Avenue, leaning against buildings, sitting together on the curb, were people with candles.  It was touching.  Not a big deal, just a sign to the world that we were out of our houses and unafraid.  Again, I was proud.  Every restaurant was open, all of them full.  People exchanging information, chatting quietly.  Around 18th Street, a really cute guy caught my eye.  He smiled as we passed.  I looked back and he looked back and stopped.  But I just couldn't talk to him.  I cry at the drop of a hat.  I don't feel particularly attractive or sexual.  As lonely as I feel right now, it wasn't the moment to meet someone new.  That's probably weird, but I have such a sense of loss and mourning that I just turned around and kept walking.  Maybe I'll run into him again sometime.  I kept walking uptown, but started to get tired and needed to see (and feed) Dex, so I hopped in a cab.  At 40th Street we were diverted again, because Port Authority Bus Terminal was barricaded by police.  The cab driver and I took it in stride and took the detour.  At home, Dex was thrilled to see me.  I could smell the dust in the air, hear sirens down the street, there were 8 new messages on my machine.  It's still a war zone.  We're all still shell-shocked.  But we're surviving.  To all of you in other parts of the country, you have to know this:  your thoughts and concern and messages and calls and emails help us feel that we're not alone.  It keeps us from being so afraid.  They mean more to us than you can imagine and we, well I, thank you with all my heart.

27,27,215223,1,41,"              The Vicious Circle  It's been raining all day.  The light in my apartment is the color of a bruise and that's the color I feel today, too.  There's a narcotic fog seeping into my head caused, not by something externally ingested, but by the toxic fumes of despair and anger.  I move around my apartment and pick up objects I know are mine, put on clothes I know belong to me, but  nothing  feels right.  And yet, I have to leave the house and pretend everything's fine (if for no one else, well then, for me).  There's just enough rain to need an umbrella and to cause confusion, the pedestrian pedestrians navigating umbrellas with no thought of the humanity below it.  I'm just as bad.  I usually walk quickly, my natural pace is fast and my legs are long, but I don't have the energy to pour it on today, and so the peripheral blur comes into slightly more focus.  I turn onto 44th Street and up ahead is the  urlLink Algonquin .  As always, I imagine myself back in time.  But instead of the 1920s, where my mind usually takes me on this street, I go back to 1983.  Before I moved to New York City, among my many oddities was a passion for the  urlLink Algonquin Round Table .  I don't remember how I found them, but more and more I wanted to lunch with them.   urlLink Dorothy Parker ,  urlLink George S. Kauffman ,  urlLink Alexander Woollcott , H urlLink  arold Ross,  urlLink Edna Ferber ,  urlLink Noel Coward , et. al.  I was a smart kid with a quick mind and a sharp tongue and I learned a lot from reading these heroes of mine.  I loved the word games ('Dorothy, use the word 'horticulture' in a sentence'), the comraderie, the insults ('Why Edna, in that suit you look almost like a man.' 'Why Noel, in that suit, so do you.').  I learned I had the talent to lacerate with my tongue and even have my victim chuckle along until he discovered he was bleeding.  I imagined moving to New York and finding a coterie of intelligent, talented friends who supported each other, complemented each other, fought and famously made up with each other.  It would make us all better and smarter and funnier and more successful and, finally, accepted.  It didn't happen exactly that way.  But imagine me in 1983, walking alone in a City where I had never been before and knew no one, with less than $200 to my name, optimistic but a little anxious, wondering if this move was right, then turning a corner and seeing the Hotel Algonquin.  I'd found a physical portal where met my fantasy, my hero worship and my new reality.  Of course, I was 20 years old and shabbily dressed, clearly I didn't belong in the lobby of the Algonquin, but with the chutzpah that a 20-year-old, freshly-minted New Yorker can muster, I pushed through the revolving door.  The lobby had changed very little from the time of  urlLink Hecht  and  urlLink MacArthur  and  urlLink Neysa McMein  and I knew it all in my mind's eye before I'd stepped foot in.  A long front desk, the tiny Blue Bar, the newsstand, the two dining rooms (the Oak Room and the Rose Room), all of it with heavy, Edwardian wainscotting.  Around the lobby are arranged comfortable leather and fabric chairs in warm, dark tones with small tables, each with a bell.  One can sit, discreetly touch the bell, and order a cocktail or tea, and read, or watch the crowd.  At least one celebrity interview or major business deal is done in these chairs every day.  I couldn't afford to sit.  If I sat, dressed as I was, and didn't order, I knew I'd be sussed out as not belonging, and I needed to stay and breathe that air a little longer.  Then I saw the phone booth.  I honestly couldn't say if that phone booth had been there from the beginning, but it sure looked like it.  Oak paneled, with an elegant bench and small table next to the payphone, with a beveled-glass door that closed (when's the last time you sat down in a phone booth and closed the door?).  Frankly, I couldn't afford a phone call either...I'd need that change later, for my generic iced tea and generic pasta with generic sauce that I'd be making on my hot plate in my residence hotel (bathroom down the hall).  But I could sit, gather my thoughts, and take in the place that epitomized my New York.  I preteneded to make a couple of calls, but mostly what I did was scan the room from my secret vantange point.   The New Yorker  became a real magazine here.  In this lobby, the germ for plays were discussed and begun, plays which shaped 20th Century American humor.  The wisecrack was more or less born here.  I didn't fall through a time portal and wake up in 1923, ready to have a drink with  urlLink Benchley  before luncheon, but while I sat there, something did happen: I breathed; the anxiety dissipated.  In a little while, I felt calm and ready to step back outside and battle the Big Apple.  I returned to the Algonquin a lot that first year.  I still couldn't afford lunch, or even tea, but I'd make my calls and loiter a bit at the newsstand, always leaving with a refreshed outlook.  Eighteen years later, and I'm walking the same streets, though much has changed.  These days I don't worry so much about how I look walking into someplace; I wear my New Yorkness like a finely-tailored Armani suit and I manage to exude something resembling confidence and strength even when (especially when) that's not what's roiling in my gut.  I'm still broke, but I can afford a smart cocktail.  And while I make mental inventories of the treasures I can sell to get myself out of my current mess, it would never occur to me that I sell a single book or letter from my treasured collection of Round Table first editions, signed limited editions, letters, documents.  They still hold more than magic for me, they represent what I still might achieve.  I'm running late.  The rain is making me later.  I've got to go pay just enough of my Con Ed bill to keep my electricity from being turned off then hurry to a temp job I hate.  I speed past the Algonquin, past the  urlLink Royalton  (Benchley: 'I must speak with that inconsiderate manager of the Royalton.  He keeps closing the 43rd Street doors during luncheon and I can't cut through their lobby to get to the Algonquin.') and I turn on my heels and head back to the Algonq.  Through those same doors.  The phone booth's been gone for years and the Blue Bar has moved to a reclaimed section of the Oak Room.  But the ghosts of my heroes still knock back the gin and sling out the barbs.  A breath; two.  Some things haven't changed:  I don't feel any less bruised, but I can make it here another day.

37,37,215223,1,41,"              Dreamweaver  So last Saturday night, the night before the Tonys (did I mention I went to the Tonys?), I had a strange dream.  It makes no sense to me, so anyone with any insight into this whatsoever, let me hear from you.  I dreamt that I was in a Broadway show and was sharing my dressing room with a good friend of mine, a girl (not someone I actually know).  We were having a great time but somehow the entire cast got abducted by some producer-types mildly connected with our show.  The took us to a sort-of dirigible, like an ocean liner, but it floated gently in the air.  There were three of them holding us hostage, sometimes at gunpoint, and finally I decided that there were more of us than them and we were gonna turn the tables on them.  I organized my cast and we overtook our captors.  I personally pushed one of the evil ones over the prow of the air-ship(his name, I remember, was Ron, but wasn't nearly as cute as  urlLink this Ron ).    Almost as soon as we had control, a storm started brewing and none of us knew how to steer the ship.  There was thunder and lightning and we were tossed around for a bit, but I finally got us toward some land and some guys on the ground grabbed our mooring ropes and helped pull us in.  We didn't know where we were or what day it was, and the gentleman who had been so helpful, didn't speak English.  I seemed to understand that we were somewhere called Zeeland.  As the  de facto  leader of the group, I started walking a small group of us around to find out where we really were and to get word back to the States.  We walked up a main road and I saw a hotel with a shanty little petting zoo next to it and I remembered being there when I was on tour in Europe.  I got everyone settled into rooms and then I settled into mine to clean up before I headed off to try to call for help.  I figured a quick shower would make me look and feel better before I found the authorities.  I had a big suite, almost like a separate cottage, but it was very low-rent banana republic.  The shower itself was large, but bordered on two sides by jalousie windows.  I was showering for a few minutes before I noticed a shape outside one of the windows.  There was a very attractive man with long black hair watching me shower.  It startled me at first, and so I said 'Hey!' which startled the man and he ran off.  I moved closer to the window to watch him run away, and then noticed that I could see the whole parking lot and there was a sort of carnival set up in it.  To my left was a small ferris wheel, and I could see some other rides as well.  Suddenly, but smoothly, the shower I was in became a sort of ride itself.  That's all I remember of this segment.  Next I was walking towards the part of town where I knew there'd be a police station.  On the way there, I passed a sort of plaza that had these concrete, futuristic umbrellas.  I remembered that on my last trip to Zeeland people had been lined up in this area to get their phone cards adjusted, etc.  I also remember one particular woman who had had a particular problem, arguing with the cashier.  I should mention at this point that Zeeland, while being a European country and, ostensibly German/Dutch speaking, looked far more like Panama, and the people looked Carribbean.  I came to the Police Station and the officer in charge while not being particularly interested in my story, was helpful enough to allow me to use his phone.  I turned to the desk next to the chair in which I was sitting, and couldn't figure out which of the items on the desk was the phone.  I reached towards a Rolodex looking item, but the officer instead flipped open a box, inside of which was an odd sort of dark turquoise-colored phone.  I tried a couple of times to make the call, but couldn't figure out how to make an outside call, and the officer assisted.  And that's all I remember of that segment.  When I got back to the room, the shot was from above and the entrance to my cottage was a more tropical version of, well (and I so hesitate to say this) Marilyn's entrance in 'Something's Gotta Give.'  Anyway.  So I get back into my room, and I notice that someone's been in there.  Then the bathroom door opens and a woman comes out.  I ask what she's doing in my room and she seems honestly confused about how she got there. Then we're somehow joined by two other women, one of whom is trying to show her clothing samples to the bathroom woman.  I'm tired from all the saving and leading I've been doing and so I finally ask these women to leave.  The clothing sample woman is miffed by this, but I don't feel bad because they shouldn't have been in my room conducting business.  As I get back into the room, I hear a knock on the door.  I figure it's the women again, but I go down a long hallway and open the door to find my entire cast, photographers flashing cameras, and cheering strangers.  It's very 'Notting Hill.'  My cast has come to collect me for a victory dinner before we head back home.  I say that I'm not quite ready to go, but I'll clean up and meet them there in a few minutes.  I have to stress that I don't feel at all caught unawares or nervous about having to get ready or about the photographers.  I just need time to dress and I'll catch up with them when I'm ready.  That's the whole dream.  Goofy, huh?  I mean, who dreams of being held hostage on a dirigible?  Apparently me.  So, what  does  that dream mean?

looked Carribbean I came to the Police Station and the officer in charge while not being particularly interested in my story was helpful enough to allow me to use his phone I turned to the desk next to the chair in which I was sitting and couldn't figure out which of the items on the desk was the phone I reached towards a Rolodex looking item but the officer instead flipped open a box inside of which was an odd sort of dark turquoise-colored phone I tried a couple of times to make the call but couldn't figure out how to make an outside call and the officer assisted And that's all I remember of that segment When I got back to the room the shot was from above and the entrance to my cottage was a more tropical version of well and I so hesitate to say this Marilyn's entrance in Something's Gotta Give Anyway So I get back into my room and I notice that someone's been in there Then the bathroom door opens and a woman comes out I ask what she's doing in my room and she seems honestly confused about how she got there Then we're somehow joined by two other women one of whom is trying to show her clothing samples to the bathroom woman I'm tired from all the saving and leading I've been doing and so I finally ask these women to leave The clothing sample woman is miffed by this but I don't feel bad because they shouldn't have been in my room conducting business As I get back into the room I hear a knock on the door I figure it's the women again but I go down a long hallway and open the door to find my entire cast photographers flashing cameras and cheering strangers It's very Notting Hill My cast has come to collect me for a victory dinner before we head back home I say that I'm not quite ready to go but I'll clean up and meet them there in a few minutes I have to stress that I don't feel at all caught unawares or nervous about having to get ready or about the photographers I just need time to dress and I'll catch up with,58,test
44,44,216413,0,26,"       Yes. It was a lovely day and a lovely night.  All started out with Tina picking me up at 4pm, telling me to get shoes and follow her. She basically kidnapped me, *lol*. Michel was waiting for us at the Uni parking lot. And that was my birthday pressie: they kidnapped me and took me to out for a picknick. Glorious, really. Such an excellent idea. We drove out into the mountains, and found a glorious spot up near some place called St.Ulrich (Geiersnest, to be specific), and relatively recently mowed field. Great view of the  urlLink Schauinsland , where Paragliders where having fun. It was lovely, really. The sky was unbelievably blue, the sun was hot, and we had this great place with a great view. Michel had baked a strawberry cake, and we three had it all. Had a bottle of champagne, too, and music, and lounged around, having a lovely time, really (even though I think Tina and I bored Michel to death with our usual girlish talk). It really was divine. Out there, I mean. *sigh* so very lovely.  Stayed out there far longer than planned, and when we were back in town (sort of around 8ish), I changed quickly, put on some make-up and headed of to Britta. We quickly cycled to Michel, who was already waiting for us. So out to the party we cycled - took about 40 minutes or so, in the going down sun. The sky an unbelievable colour of blue. It was so lovely, really, even though a pretty evil ride. Nice though, through the fields and the vineyards. Absolutely divine.  The party was divine. We partied from dusk till dawn, really. Simply the location rocked - a really large, open hut at the edge of the forest, right behind the vineyard. Lots of tables and benches in front, a large bar and dancefloor inside. Excellent 89's and 90's music which reminded me of being 15 and happy. The sky was getting darker and darker, and the moon was all small and it was just divine.  Michel, Britta and I started the night out with some beers and some champagne, sat down and quickly started to chat with some girl whose name I have already forgotten. Fritz came and brought another bottle of champagne, too; Michel went off to chat up some girls who he spend most of the party with (which was great, I was very happy to see him there having fun), and the sister of the girl who sat with us turned up, together with a guy who I thought was her boyfriend, a really interesting guy called Johannes. Talked about tons of things, Australia ans New Zealand, and this and that I got to tell the 'all you need is love' story again, too,when one of Fritz's friends came over and told me she had seen Ev and me on TV back In January. *sigh*  After the Champagne bottle and some more drinks (and the first woodruff flavoured wobbly vodka jelly of the evening), the two girls, and Johannes and Britta and I moved over to the dance floor, even though the music was relatively crappy at that moment and we started to convince the icky DJ guy to put on better music, which he did after a while, and we danced. And had more drinks. And more jelly things, And just enjoyed ourselves. Cool music then, New Model Army, Nena and INXS and other good old 80's stuff and we screamed along and it was good ( '....mystify....mystify me.....' ). At some point, the two girls left, while Johannes stayed, which was kinda odd, because I thought he was the boyfriend after all. But anyway. He started to flirt rather wildly, which sure was funky and good. After all, flirting is okay (and the ground rule is:  'flirting ends where kissing begins' ) and fun. So we danced and screamed and had more drinks and it was all good. Johannes and I talked about music, too, and he apparently liked what I like and found my confession that I liked The Sisters of Mercy back in my youth adorable and was practically willing to kiss the ground that I walk on. *rofl* That sure was good for my ego.  Still didn't think anything of it all. Was just having a lovely time. And after all, he knew that I am taken (or at least I thought so) and he had a girlfriend, too (or so I thought). Well, it got to  point when I realised I had to pull up my barricades again (when someone makes it quite obvious that kissing should be next and you don't want to, you should say so, I think), and so I did that. Ick. I hated it. He obviously had not heard the story of 'all you need is love' as I was telling it earltier and hence didn't know I had someone. And apparently, the girl wasn't his girfriend either. Oy. And he is a cutie after all. A cutie I liked but not one I wanted. Seriously. Not for one moment did I think that anything should happen with me and him. Not for a sec. The hunting was fun. The kill wouldn't have been. I want Ev. I want to be monogamous. I want something only he can give me. And nope, this flirting - even though it was good -  wasn't even half as thrilling to make me think about *doing* anything more than flirting for a second or two.  So I had quite obviously pulled an evil typical girl thing - the ego boost. Hmph. Not nice. Oh how I hated that. If he had been in a relationship, too, it all wouldn't have been half as bad, me thinks. Ick. So I thought the rules were there (that this was gonna be flirting, nothing else) when they really weren't. Hmph. Dumb.  Very not elegant. And so I went off to get another drink or whatever else. And next time I look at the dancefloor, Britta and Johannes are smooching. I almost died laughing. There I was, one minute feeling guilty for possibly hurting someone and leading someone on, next minute he is smooching the friend I am at the party with. So the pain can't have been that bad (or he wanted to pay me back, which really didn't work out). It was hilarious. I really hyperventilated because it was so funny. How good I really didn't waste more than a minute on feeling guilty. So the rest of the party was spend laughing about this, dancing some more, drinking some more.  What made me feel bad though was that this was Britta's first kiss (or at least it looked like a kiss, she told me today, they really didn't kiss much. He kissed her face and that was that). And that this was yet another episode of: Caro gets it all (or can get it all), Britta gets nothing. And Johannes settled for the 'leftover'. Sickening, actually. So the evening faded away, really. It was starting to dawn. Danced some more, almost all alone, which was funky, despite it all, I was in a good mood and felt strong & sexy and good and whatnot. Later, Michel and I sat in the middle of the path between the vineyards and talked. Quite nicely. The girl he had been entertaining all evening was apparently really nice, but he was kinda sad he didn't go along and smooch, too, so we were sitting there being jealous of Britta in a way. And I missed Ev. A lot. Tons. And sitting there, I felt that it was right the way it was. Ev and me, I mean. Being monogamous. Flirting just showed me that while I find the hunt nice and entertaining, the kill really wouldn't give me anything these days. Because the only person I want is Ev.  We left soon afterwards. Despite it all, I gave Johannes my eMail addie. Not because I need more of an ego boost. Just because he is a nice guy I'd like to get to know better. And anyone who is not a law guy is good.  On the way home (riding downhill through the vineyards in the cold of dawn), it dawned on Britta that Johannes had been heavily flirting with me, and when she asked, I told her what happened. Which quite hampered her mood. Oy. She was still quite excited about the possibilty of him calling and whatnot. Oy oy.  Riding a bike after a night of heavy drinking is not always a good idea, actually. Michael and I crashed somewhere near G.town, when he hit the brakes for no apparent reason and I ran into him. Fell all on my left side, injured my elbow (all scratched an bruised) and got myself a nice collection of bruises on my legs, too. But well, there is always  some  kind of loss.  Michel and Britta came home with me (it was 6am by then) and we had some sort of breakfast (tea, coffee, bread rolls for the two of them,  cold leftover pasta for me),  before I fell asleep (or in a coma) on my floor. And the two decided to leave. *lol*. I am not a good hostess. I even removed my make up, brushed my teeth and all before I fell into bed. Woke up after not even 3 hours when I lost my sleeping mask (I sleep best in the dark, and during the day, you can't get my flat dark enough, hence the mask). Ick. No headache. But tiredness. Tiredness. More tiredness. And no clear thoughts. Had a shower. Had the last bit of pasta. Chatted with Linnie. Slept some more later. Didn't get out on the balcony because it was so hot and I feared that the left over alcohol would kill me if I sat in the sun. Didn't get fully up until late in the afternoon, really. Even went to Britta and brought her bike back. She seemed a lot more realistic then earlier in the day. Even though she totally blew this Johannes thing out of proportion. Like making up things that she would say in case he calls. Hmph.  So this was a good party, all in all. A little like being back in High School. *lol* Oh, the drama. I managed to stay on the right amount of alcohol all night. Excellent.  What annoyed me most about this Johannes thing wasn't that someone 'got over me' in a matter of minutes (or wanted to make me realize what I missed out on?) but more that it played into the entire problem thing that has been an issue in my friendship with Britta. I am the one who has the boyfriend. The one who is experienced & easy going & whatever else. The one who - on a good night - feels at home in her skin and plays with her charme and flirts, just for the heck of it. The one who can have 'someone' whenever she wants (that sure is an exaggeration, but you get my drift, I reckon). Britta is the complete opposite. She has never had a partner. She has never kissed. She has never had sex. She has some issues with insecurity & coming across as the friend type, not the girlfriend type. Her virginity is a stigma for her. Totally. No matter how hard I try to re-assure her it isn't so. Someone who has had plenty of sex can always say it isn't a biggie. And after a few years (5 or so, to be exact), the line does get a little old.  And now this Johannes thing totally played into this thing. Totally. Someone who couldn't *get* me, settled for her. Ick. She gets what I don't want, if she gets anything at all.  Ick. Ick. Ick.  And he knew what he was doing there. No doubt about it. He even commented that he thought she was insecure. How sickening is that?  Anyway. Even though this all sounds rather bad now, in type, I mean. It was indeed a hilarious day & evening. It was fun. Even the drama had an entertaining quality about it. I need more days & nights like this one. Definitely. I need fun and dancing and interesting people and dancing under stars and sitting on hills having strawberry cake and laughing about someone who's pulling a shitty trick and feeling good in missing Ev.  Off to bed now. I need sleep. More sleep. Lots of sleep.

52,52,216413,0,26,"       why is it so hard for some people to recognize diary frauds?  a diary i had perviously never heard of went bust these past days. the regular readership of that diary shows the usual behaviour: outraged/amused/upset or still in denial. the apparent facts uncovered by that readership show that the creator of that diary lied, faked, lied, faked and lied some more, and has done so in at least one, possibly two previous incarnation(s).  with some time on my hands today, i read what is still left of that diary. while i could see why that diary gathered a big following, it made me wonder how anyone could believe that those writings were real in the first place. - the thing simply had all the usual signs of fraud written all over it.  there was drama, drama and more drama. there was an endless string of crisis, emergencies, borderline personality type behaviour, all over the place. there was simply too much happening, too. people taken into the house, babies being born, an internet start-up, affairs, affairs, even more affairs. there was enough sex for to fill a bunch of porn-scripts. the character was lesbian, and within a week apparently bedded 3 straight women. the language was very descriptive, abundant with adjectives and monologue. while some online writers use prose-like language and lots of dialogue. most of the time their personality shines through the prose and the dialogue. to me, real diary writing is usually..well, personal. lived. call it real, if you wnat.  nothing written on that diary seemed 'lived' to me. it seemed dreamed, wished for, essentially imagined. crafted. apart from the elaborate wordings and strange descriptions, to me, the sex scenes gave it away. they were so..impersonal. the girl on girl sex sounded like the script for bad porn aimed at men. i don't doubt that there are lesbians in minnesota who love sex and enjoy strap-ons and who have lots of sex - i know that for a fact actually, because  urlLink heather  is one of them, - i just doubt that a minnesota lesbian that enjoys strap-ons would write about her sexual adventures as if she were a bloke, with bloke language. read heather. she's real, and her strap-ons, girls and sex are, too.   urlLink scarleteen  taught me a lot about realizing when someone is fraudulently posting. it was usually the drama that gave them away. the stories were usually outrageous and so complicated that they made the mind boogle. strangely enough, all fraudsters somehow managed to come up with eerily similar stories.  'pregant at 13 by mom's boyfriend, being thrown out of the house'  is an old favourite. the bored middle class girls in front of their computers who post that and similar crap don't realise they are diverting attention and time from those who actually are in trouble and need help. and that they are numbing the communities they troll at for the unfortunate few girls that actually are in that awful position. a pedophile once made up a drama prone lesbian teens that was into videotaping sex, trying to coax real teenage lesbian board members into swapping pics. a  middle aged man once went to extraordinary lenghts to establish a college-age lesbian persona in the online erotica and sex-ed communities as well, tricking many people in the process, making an austrian girl travel to the us to meet 'her', later claiming that he was a pre-op transsexual. he didn't explain though, why there was that 30 year gap between his male and female personality. duh. back in the old opendiary days, i remember a diary that was quite similar in style of this recent fraud. it was about a harvard-studying, world-travelling, beautiful, genius teenage girl. on top of that, she had a rare disease, was still a virgin, did a triple degree, was bisexual and had an entourage of equally talented good looking boys who all kept diaries at opendiary, too! how useful! she comitted suicide by drowning herself in the canale grande in venice on ash wednesday, by the way. it was a captivating read, actually. - but oh. so. very. fake. strangely enough, all those people managed to draw copious amounts of people into their fabrications, getting them emotionally involved through and into their lies. sudden deaths, long breaks and disappearaces are essential to getting people worried about you, too. those fake people seem like vampires to me; sucking the attention out of too well-meaning, easily believing onlookers, feeding on their care.  it might be a hard realisation for those who feed the needs of those who keep fake diaries, who are drawn to the drama and want to help, urgently: real life is generally pretty boring and, well, normal. unless you are  urlLink salam pax , i guess.  life is about family and love and work and what you do on the weekend. it's about what happens in your city, in your community. it's about the things you enjoy, the things you hate, what you cook for dinner and where you holiday. it's the odd scene you passed by on your way to work. the ex-boyfriend you saw at the pub. whatever. 'life' is what happens to someone every day.  sure, some people write only about certain aspects of their lives online, events they think will entertain others, events they enjoy sharing, things that present an image they like. - who could blame them? selecting what to write online is a way of shaping your memories and a way of shaping the image others have of you. i do that, too, and i think everyone does, more or less.  of course, everyone has times of drama and crisis and big events. good grace, if i think back to last year, even i had lots of drama. in the span of about 2 months, i split up with a boyfriend of almost 4 years who i had wanted to marry and move countries for; had an affair with someone from another country that i had met through diary writing (hurting him in the process, which i still feel awful about) and meeting dirk, essentially moving in with him within weeks. yeah, that was some drama. it was all real though. because it was so real, and because it was so weird and strange and hurtful for real, actual people, i never told the full story online, and never will. i left out things, edited myself, because i knew people involved were reading. and i still made awful, awful mistakes in the whole process. that's real life to me.  life for most people is not piggyback rides in the sunset just hours before you die (which another diary fraud claimed) or turning three people in a week into lesbians. not that i don't wish that life *should* be like that for more people. maybe that's another appeal of fraudulent diaries: people would love to have lives that exciting as well, with world travels, dinners on barcelona rooftop balconies, an ivy league college and more lovers than one can handle.  just today i got an email from someone telling me that even though he is a bloke, he can relate to what i write. - that's a fabulous compliment to get, i think. to me, it's a given that men can relate to what women write, and women can relate to what men write. at least to what we all write with an open heart. to me, the essence of writing and putting personal things online, and reading the personal things others put online, is connection. connection through universal feelings and events.  i read about someones experiences, and even if they are totally different to anything i have or anything i will ever experience, if it was written it with an open heart, i'll be able to relate to it. it doesn't matter if it's someone unlike me: a bloke with dyed hair in socal working in porn; a woman in australia worrying about her dying father; a mother writing about life with three young kids, describing her days, and how she and her marriage have to step back at times. it doesn't matter what the emotion is, it doesn't have to be all gloom and doom; humour offers real connection, too, i think. written with an open heart, honest writings enable others to get a glimpse of what the writer feels, share the joy and the burden and feel with them. in my opinion, many people read journals to recognise things about themselves, to not feel so alone with their feelings. to connect.  aren't we all just looking for connection?  i will sound all esoteric now, but i believe that we are all waves in the big old ocean of life. we are all, essentially, the same on the inside, even if no two waves look exactly alike. we have so much in common though, and we are all in this together.  how sad we rarely take the time to notice. how sad that those online frauds feed on that essentially human desire to feel the connection.  so why is it so hard for people to recognize diary frauds? - in my opinion, it is because we want to believe, because we want to connect, because we need that connection.  look at the waves, feel the ocean.  it is that easy, and that complicated, at the same time.   &middot &middot &middot &middot &middot &middot &middot &middot &middot &middot &middot &middot    post scriptum.  if in doubt that i am who i claim to be:  i have had telephone conversations with about half a dozen scarleteeners, including  urlLink heather , who also has a copy of my id. i have met another half dozen scarleeteeners, journaling and online people in person, among them the smart, adorable  urlLink seska  (nsfw).  so this caro person exists, and i am real. and really, who'd make up a life as everyday and uneventful as mine?  thankyou. goodnight.

happiness, and sex, and booze, and dope, and the sun, do not spark great intellectual thoughts overall, i find.  dirk and i have been together much of the time, too, so there has neither been time nor desire to sit down at the computer to create a moment for thinking and writing. - been too busy lying at the dreisam, talking and reading, too busy sitting on the balcony, too busy being busy with

of 2003, the last three months specifically. it's been choc full of change and thoughts and realisations, this 2003. as strange as it may sound, but with all the ass-kicking and hurt and fear and screaming and crying it has been treating me well, this year, waking me up, bringing me to life again, changing me, for the better.  no wonder i couldn't see myself where i am right now. - out of my mind happy. truly, madly, deeply in love with a man like dirk. pondering life, feeling like groundbreaking decisions are waiting just around the corner.  i don't blame myself: how could i have imagined any of this? it seemed set in stone (at least superficially, not deep down inside of myself) that life with evan in melbourne, marrying him, moving, having children, doing law for the rest of my life. anything but the plan with evan had turned into an non option, which, i guess, was the beginning of the end in a way for him and me anyway. no wonder i never even wondered whether there might be something better for me, something healthier, someone else, someone who truly wants me, someone i truly want, too. strangely enough all those silly, silly plans i had made, what i thought our wedding should be like, what have you, now seem insane, and like nothing i could, would do. ever.  i felt strongly for evan. i loved him. it's strange to realise that that has changed, completely, and that it had for months, which i just didn't want to realise when it happened, which was obvious in my wondering  'so this is it?'  while in was in australia this past winter. we talked sometime this past week, evan and i, and it is gone, whatever i felt for him in the boyfriend/girlfriend category. i love him, still, somehow, as a friend, if you will, and there is no residual anger, no pain, no hurt from the break-up left. i feel love for him because of the time we spend together, these years. i talked about it with dirk yesterday, wanting to say that i still love evan in some way because we know each other so well, but i realised that would have been a lie. sure, we knew lots about each other, but i can't help but wonder how much of it was real. back then, my thought was  i wish i could be who you wanted all the time , so i constructed a version of myself i thought he would love. sure, i know lots about him, little thing, big things, but considering how long it took him to be honest with me regarding his feeling about my move, i wonder how much i truly, deeply know about him. there are things i suspect right now, that i can't, won't post here, things i feel i know about him, that i wonder about, wonder whether they are accurate, and if they are, whether he knows them yet, will act about them, be honest to himself. it's a strange thing, knowing someone. talking to evan briefly on thursday, i was mainly happy to hear his voice, happy to laugh with him, but very strongly felt that he might become a lifelong friend, but could have never ever been my life partner. i told him so. i wonder whether it freaked him out.  what i feel for dirk now is just so very very  different  on so many levels, that i have trouble expressing it without sounding like a lunatic or on the rebound. - and i am neither.  i wish evan could see me now, not because i want to hurt him or want him to see what he is missing out on. i want him to see me, because i think he should see me, the real me, just once. i want him to see the changed outside, make-up less, dressed down, skinny, long haired, tanned caro, and my changed inner me, this much more unsure about life, undepressed, completely and utterly happy in her own skin caro. the one who sleeps outside waiting for shooting stars, who swims topless in a lake, who loves yoga and reads the bhagavad gita, who is finally enlarging her circle of friends again, who feels like she needs little in life for happiness. i doubt he would recognise me.  i read in my old diaries today, about what i did and where i was on my birthday the last few years since moving here, and it makes me realise how changed i am, too. the 1998 birthday had a drinking session on my balcony with the two tinas and some frat boys at my old flat. in 1999, i had a big ass party with moritz at the frat place, a party that got really expensive because so much beer was consumed, and where half the people didn't even know it was my birthday. i remember being sad because didi didn't even call, and ogled arndt, who's getting married one of these weekends. in 2000, i had a party here at my place, as pictures from then tell me. 2001 was spend with michel and tina and britta, first on a hill near the schauinsland and later at fritz's party in denzlingen, which was fucking awesome. most people i spend those birthdays with are people i am not in touch with any longer, for a multitude of reasons. last year, i spend the day pretty much alone.  tomorrow, i will spend the day with dirk. - there will be partying with the yoga people on tuesday, at silke's birthday party, how convenient for me, and there is no one else i feel the need to party with. dirk and i, we will head to the health department in the morning, for free hiv testing (isn't that a great birthday date?). dieter asked us to come by the laundromat to have a bottle of bubbly to celebrate my birthday as well, so we'll do that afterwards. then we'll quite likely take the bikes and find a lake or a field or a hill to lie around on or next to, picknicking and spending the day together. big time cycling might be out of the question: it looks like it is going to be above 35 again tomorrow, just like today, and the heat is mind-numbing and tiring. it will, doubtlessly, be a lovely day, just like these last days have been lovely.  what a year it has been, this last one. what a year will it be, this coming one? i can't wait for more of this change. time to leap into it.     chromatic i stand on the side of the road watching for a car a truck so I can go i've got to get myself out of this nothing place i've been running around with a tied shoe lace  what a year it has been what a year it has been lost my love shed my skin what a year it has been  there's a cheer leader squad on the side of the road cheering the night now for somewhere to go there's me on the corner the corner is home look at the controller we're about to hit a new zone  flashing lights from up above so close too close was crazy love so gather up your broken brow millions together will do it somehow  'what a year'  ~alex lloyd~           ",5155,1000,what a year it has been it's my birthday tomorrow and with that comes as usual a reflective frame of mind there hasn't been much headspace to think these past days happiness and sex and booze and dope and the sun do not spark great intellectual thoughts overall i find dirk and i have been together much of the time too so there has neither been time nor desire to sit down at the computer to create a moment for thinking and writing been too busy lying at the dreisam talking and reading too busy sitting on the balcony too busy being busy with each other he's been away now and there is time to think and write for me while he is grass boarding with michi coming over again sometime later today to be here when my birthday starts it's strange to realise is already halfway over strange that it's my birthday yet again that i'm slowly heading from mid-twenties to late twenties strange to realise that right now i am in a place completely different to the one i thought i would be in on my birthday one two three years ago i

56,56,216413,0,26,"       i am feeling a tiny little bit better, healthwise, at least compared to yesterday. yesterday was awful; i felt progressively worse during the day and got pretty scared when i couldn't speak at all by nighttime. it happened as i was calling dirk, i just couldn't get words out, all i could do was cough and hoarsely whisper. dirk didn't even recognize my voice. duh. can't blame him. so today is better, and that's good. slept a little bit better (albeit not much), can speak a little, can think a little, the headache and facial pain are bearable, the muscle and joint pain, too.  depending on how i'll feel tomorrow, i might still go to the docs in the morning, just to check. the self-diagnosis is that of a simple common cold that has turned into sinusitis and laryngitis;  the latter could be to blame for that muscle and joint pain, i guess. it's awful, and i never really had that before. so yeah. i still look like shit, too, swollen face and neck and huge bags under my eyes. there's a lecture i should go to at 2pm tomorrow, i'll see whether i can manage: considering the short 10 minute walk to the bakery this morning left me needing a nap afterwards, i am not so sure. i'll see how it goes.  i just hate being sick. i hate it so much, and the last few months have had so much sickness and so many disease scares, i've had enough for a few years.  in late november, after a few weeks of very intense work, i had sudden hearing loss in my left ear. it happened after a week that consisted of an exam, a 3 day ip seminar where i held a presentation (and hardly slept, because of socialising, preparation for that presentation and attending a 5am morning vesper mass) and a day of 15 hours of market research work at a noisy, busy airport. that same day, my grandma died, news that weren't surprising, but pretty bad nonetheless. when i arrived back home that night, i was totally wiped out, cried for a while, while dirk tried to comfort me, and feel into bed. i woke up at about 3am, with an awful, awful noise in my ear, that wouldn't go away. i felt like i was under water, one side of me at least. no matter how many times i tried to 'un-pop' my ear, it just wouldn't change at all. the noise in my head totally stressed me out, i started to get totally irrational and scared. the noise and the balance problems were  totally frightening. unfortunately, i didn't know that those psychological symptoms are part of sudden hearing loss. - i might have been able to relax a little, if i had know. i went to the er early that morning, where they couldn't do much but tell me to go to the ent later that day, which i did. hearing tests showed massive hearing loss. i also had tinnitus in that ear. with swift treatment (basically blood-thinning meds) and silence and relaxing and sleeping, my hearing returned over the course of a few days. the  urlLink '>tinnitus  stayed though; even though it has gotten a lot better in recent weeks. just now, with this cold, it has made a return.  it was an awful experience. it didn't help, that the cause of that kind of hearing loss is not quite understood: some think it's a circulation issue; others reckon an electrolyte balance inside the ear is to blame, in some cases it's noise. the main belief is, that it's caused by stress and personality structure. obsessive-compulsives are quite prone to it. uhm, yeah, stress. obesessiveness. yeah. interestingly enough, phil collins had sudden hearing loss, too, and still has tinnitus as well.  another possible cause for sudden hearing loss is  urlLink acoustic neuroma , a tumor on the hearing nerve. it's pretty rare, but apparently pretty frequent in cases of hearing loss at my age. yeah, a brain tumor. that kinda scared me. a whole lot, actually. after several hours worth of tests, that was ruled out though. quite a relief.  after that whole hearing loss drama, i had a massive bout of flu that knocked me out over christmas. then came an intense allergic reaction, and tests showed that i am allergic to a wide variety of metals, sheep wool (!), molds of various kinds, foods (including sea food, milk etc.) and a whole lot more. yeah. after that, after changing my bcp prescription, i had awful full-body-itching, which i though to be a side effect, while my gyno thought it to be the onset of  urlLink acute intermittent porphyria , a chronic liver disease. yeah. more scary shit. a gastroenterologist sorted me out though, and my liver is fine. then, in march, the good old tension headache made a dramatic little return. muscle relexants and a few low doses of elavil did the trick though, and i talked my doc into giving me a prescription for 6 session with a physiotherapist, and those have helped tremendously. still have 3 to go, and they are such fun. it seems that my first vertebrae is to blame, so the physio (young, pretty and muscular) searches out the muscles supporting my head, presses certain spots for a while (which hurts, hurts, hurts), but afterwards, i feel better. pretty amazing. evan's new partner is a physiotherapist, too; i can understand how he chose an apparently less intellectually interesting (his words, not mine) relationship with someone with those manual skills over an ldr with me. surely nice to have someone with those skills nearby at all times. i'd like that, too. he.  so yeah, in general, i think my body has been telling me, in pretty dramatic ways, that something simply isn't right  in my life and that i need to change something. like my obsessiveness, my stress levels, the way i approach life. so hard to make those changes though.  if i get so run down with the little things i have to deal with in my life, how am i supposed to handle a full-time job/kids/the real world? kinda scary. the doc told me, after the hearing loss, that if i didn't change life now, i'd quite likely keep having trouble for the rest of my life. he compared the hearing loss to the ulcers other people get when stressed, or the ibs, or whatever else.  i know working out helps with my stress, but i get so stressed out about doing the 'perfect' amount of exercise, that it stresses me, too. i know yoga helps me with stress, but the whole cult-drama surrounding ralf has turned me off his classes, totally. yoga practice by myself is good too, but i get upset if i don't do it 'perfectly', i.e. get up before 6am each and every morning to do a full sivananda session before uni, including pranayama and meditation. i know this isn't a sane or healthy or yogic approach at all. i should take it as it comes, and be glad with it, but i can't. same with eating and stayin hydrated. good eating helps me stay energised, but during the week, i find it hard to find the energy to cook good meals, even though it's important to plan those a little as a new vegan. i've gained some weight with the bcp change, too, which has made me all obsessed with weight again. it's like a vicious circle.  i know i should tackle it all one little baby step at a time, but it seems overwhelming to get my health and life into a bit of an order. i should probably simply quit wanting to do everything perfectly. easier said than done. gah.  at least i've had a healthy meal today. and yesterday, too. all almost completely vegan as well (apart from some milk in the frozen spinach i used for my pasta). that's something. and i resisted the  urlLink aspirin & pseudoephedrine  so far. little miracle symptom masker that it is, i really didn't feel like feeling all high today (pseudoephedrine does that to me, i'm super sensitive to it), just to totally crash tomorrow, when it's time for uni again, and when a whole week of work, and a weekend of work and travel is ahead of me. and i slept okay. and i got some fresh air. and i marvelled at the plants on my balcony. and i relaxed, watching  urlLink crossroads , and loving it, all its inconsistencies and shallowness included.  overall, considering the sick-ness, i guess it was as good as it could be, alone at home and all. good on me. can't wait for the man to come home though: life is simply better when he is around. a lot better. how good i still have three more days to regain health and beauty before he returns. &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink            ",5373,1000,i am feeling a tiny little bit

59,59,216413,0,26,"       it's been a perfect day at the tour, perfect from start to finish.  it started as we were driving into besancon. a phonak van was in front of us, and a cyclist, too, and as we drove past, i realised that it was  urlLink oscar sevilla , warming up. yay!  my dad and i found a good parking spot, just about 500m away from the tour route in downtown besancon, about 2 cycling minutes behind the starting area. it was a perfect viewing spot, too, a long ascent where you could see far in both directions, with a bend, too. no careful planning could have provided us with&nbsp;a better spot, really.  we had lovely neighbours standing next to us. to the left a super-friendly french father and son team. we had fun attempting to actually discuss cycling with bits of french, german and the use of hands and feet. to our right was a group of american blokes in their early thirties (chris, doug and alex) all of them currently living in basel. chris, was as much of a cycling crack as me, so i had someone to discuss cycling things with en detail, you know, whether  urlLink robbie mcewen &nbsp;is a fair cyclist, whether  urlLink thomas voeckler  might win the tour one day, why the people who were calling  urlLink jens voigt   'judas'  on the way up l'alpe d'huez have no clue about cycling etc.  the other two were tour virgins. alex, though being a tour first timer, turned out to be interesting company, too. he used to be in the marine corps, went to iraq last year, and he's not in support of dubya. an interesting conversation was had between the two of us on american foreign politics and everything else and it might get into a second round, too, as basel is just an hour away, and as he has only been to freiburg briefly. we might&nbsp;go to next saturdays  urlLink time trial 2  in bhl as well, or at least i asked chris and him.&nbsp;it would surely be nice. lance will be there, after all, as well. alex, doug and chris were meticulously prepared: they had lots of good food (including giant sandwiches and fruit salad), beer to share (!) and an american flag.  so i ended up standing in front of, or next to an american flag for the whole day, mostly speaking english, too, and wearing my  urlLink 'live strong'  shirt supporting lance. the only way to not appear american would have been a large&nbsp; 'i'm german, though!'  sign, but that would have gotten in the way with the clapping, cheering and photographing. so i tried not to care too much. our little group was later joined by fred, another american and a complete tour viewing pro for years who was fun to talk to as well. he actually spend yesterday in paris, lucky him.  so my dad and i were in good company, in a good spot, and in such a good mood that the awful amount rain that came down on and off for the first few hours didn't matter that much.&nbsp; later it got hot and sunny and perfect. i could not come up with a better place to be, a better thing to do than standing at the side of the road in besancon, in the sun, waiting for lance in good company, drinking beer. i was totally and completely and utterly happy. and i still am, actually.  and then the riders came, jimmy casper, laterne rouge, being the first one. and the fun started. the atmo was lovely, the cheering was good because among those last riders there were tons and tons of french. at some point, my dad went to a different space to watch, and while that wasn't exactly what i had hoped for for our father/daughter tour de france weekend, it was alright. i wasn't all by myself, after all.  so we cheered. we guessed who was coming next, because no one had brought, and no one around us had, a classement generale from the previous day (i had tried to but the internet cafe suffered from dsl death friday night). we tried to come up with all the first names of the riders riding past, as the cars following them only showed their last names. we did an organised  'aussie aussie aussie! oi! oi! oi!'  cheer for the aussie riders. we spoke cycling. we cheered. i took lots pictures and some even turned out fabulous (blessed be my mothers' minolta dimage camera). if that law thing won't work, i'll be the next  urlLink graham watson . he.  between the riders, some of those who had already finished were already cycling home. poor  urlLink liberty seguros cyclists  not only had to ride home, but they had to ride home with big backpacks on their backs as well. i would have expected them to have better funding.  at some point, three  urlLink t-mobile  people, among them  urlLink erik zabel , were riding home slowly (and without backpacks) among lots of cheering and clapping and hoopla. zabel looked totally happy and relaxed, being on his way home and all, and started giving high fives to fans as he rode past.  tour de france groupie confession of the day: i shared high fives with erik zabel. ha!  i have washed my hands since then though. because as lovely as erik is, he ain't lance after all.  so what can i say? it was a lovely day. late in the afternoon, the top ten riders cycled past, the cheering got more intense, the excitement got, too, and then it were jan ullrich, andreas klden and ivan basso riding past, all 2 minutes apart from each other, and then came lance, riding furiously and faster and better than everyone else, everyone cheered and clapped, the maillot jaune was shining in the sun, and within seconds lance had passed, and the moment had, too, and the spectacle was over. they were the highlight of it all, of course, these few seconds (and i have a video to relive the moment, too) and then everyone went home.  we said our goodbyes, the blokes and i, my dad came back to the spot i was standing, and we started walking back to the car.  all day, i had seen people wearing lance's yellow  urlLink 'live strong'  wristband, and all day i couldn't make myself ask one of them whether they got them from somewhere right there, or whether they had brought them from home, having bought them from the net. because i longed for one. i've longed for one for ages. on the way to the car, there was a huge group of american cycling tourists, all very fit looking, all wearing yellow 'live strong' wristbands, right in front of me. so i finally chatted to the man right in front of me.  'excuse me sir, i just realised that you're all wearing the live strong wristbands. did you get them around here somewhere?'  it must have been a bit odd to be asked that by someone wearing a yellow t-shirt inscribed with 'live strong'. he explained that they got them earlier during the day from a car during the caravane. i said something about not seeing that and he was friendly enough to explain that you could get them at niketown shops in the us, and online, too, to which i replied that i knew that, but that they didn't ship overseas. i thanked him for the info, we said goodbye, and he walked faster, returning to his group. i was a bit bummed out that i had missed that chance to get that muchly desired wristband and my total high of a day of tour watching, was just a little bit dulled. just a tiny tiny little bit. and then, with a few steps, the american cycling tourist came back to me, the yellow wristband that had been dangling round his right wrist now in his hand, and he pushed it into mine, saying something like  'you know what? there you go, have mine, i know you'll really enjoy it'.  and i was stunned.  'thank you. thank you so much. you've just made my day even better than it already is.'  i replied.  'i thought so!'  he said to me, smiling broadly, jogging back to his group. that's cycling fans.  a day at the tour. can you imagine anything better to do in july? i most certainly can't.

right was a group of american blokes in their early thirties chris doug and alex all of them currently living in basel chris was as much of a cycling crack as me so i had someone to discuss cycling things with en detail you know whether robbie mcewen nbsp;is a fair cyclist whether thomas voeckler might win the tour one day why the people who were calling jens voigt judas on the way up l'alpe d'huez have no clue about cycling etc the other two were tour virgins alex though being a tour first timer turned out to be interesting company too he used to be in the marine corps went to iraq last year and he's not in support of dubya an interesting conversation was had between the two of us on american foreign politics and everything else and it might get into a second round too as basel is just an hour away and as he has only been to freiburg briefly we might&nbsp;go to next saturdays time trial in bhl as well or at least i asked chris and him.&nbsp;it would surely be nice lance will be there after all as well alex doug and chris were meticulously prepared they had lots of good food including giant sandwiches and fruit salad beer to share and an american flag so i ended up standing in front of or next to an american flag for the whole day mostly speaking english too and wearing my live strong shirt supporting lance the only way to not appear american would have been a large&nbsp i'm german though sign but that would have gotten in the way with the clapping cheering and photographing so i tried not to care too much our little group was later joined by fred another american and a complete tour viewing pro for years who was fun to talk to as well he actually spend yesterday in paris lucky him so my dad and i were in good company in a good spot and in such a good mood that the awful amount rain that came down on and off for the first few hours didn't matter that much.&nbsp later it got hot and sunny and perfect i could not come up with a better place to be a better thing to do than standing at the side of the road in besancon in the sun waiting for lance in good company drinking beer i was totally and completely and utterly happy and i still am actually and then the riders came jimmy casper laterne rouge being the first one and the fun started the atmo was lovely the cheering was good because among those last riders there were tons and tons of french at some point my dad went to a different space to watch and while that wasn't exactly what i had hoped for for our father/daughter tour de france weekend it was alright i wasn't all by myself after all so we cheered we guessed who was coming next because no one had brought and no one around us had a classement generale from the previous day i had tried to but the internet cafe suffered from dsl death friday night we tried to come up with all the first names of the riders riding past as the cars following them only showed their last names we did an organised aussie aussie aussie oi oi oi cheer for the aussie riders we spoke cycling we cheered i took lots pictures and some even turned out fabulous blessed be my mothers minolta dimage camera if that law thing won't work i'll be the next graham watson he between the riders some of those who had already finished were already cycling home poor liberty seguros cyclists not only had to ride home but they had to ride home with big backpacks on their backs as well i would have expected them to have better funding at some point three t-mobile people among them erik zabel were riding home slowly and without backpacks among lots of cheering and clapping and hoopla zabel looked totally happy and relaxed being on his way home and all and started giving high fives to fans as he rode past tour de france groupie confession of the day i shared high fives with erik zabel ha i have washed my hands since then though because as lovely as erik is he ain't lance after all so what can i say it was a lovely day late in the afternoon the top ten riders cycled past the cheering got more intense the excitement got too and then it were jan ullrich andreas klden and ivan basso riding past all minutes apart from each other and then came lance riding furiously and faster and better than everyone else everyone cheered and clapped the maillot jaune was shining in the sun and within seconds lance had passed and the moment had too and the spectacle was over they were the highlight of it all of course these few seconds and i have a video to relive the,89,test
66,66,216413,0,26,"       *yawn*  The weekend was nice. If you do not take the weather into consideration, that is.  In case you get the posibility to watch today's Tour stage on TV where you are ( urlLink le tour.com  has worldwide scedules), use that chance and take a good look at that weather. I felt really sorry for the riders, today was a day when I would have never wanted to be on a bike for 5 hours. No matter what glory would be ahead for me. Standing at the side of the road was icky enough. It was cold. It was wet.  It was still funky though, all in all. Saturday, after we had decided that it was way to late to try to get up into the mountains, Dad and I had a good place about 1000m away from the finish line in downtown Colmar, at a double-curve (just as last year), next to nice and friendly people from all over Europe, basically. It rained on and off while the caravane came through, lots of stuff like last year, still funny though. The funky thing was that when the field finally arrived, it was nicely spread out, and we got 25 minutes of arrival action, with  urlLink Lance Armstrong  and Jan Ullrich both coming in with the pack and a German chap riding for french team Credit Agricole winning the meillot jeune. Great arrival.  Once we were home, after some beers and a little rest, Dad and I went out for dinner. Looked at various restaurants but with it being Saturday night, it was pretty hard to find a place somewhere nice. Ended up at one of the more traditional Restaurants on cathedral square, the food was great (far better than the last time I went there), and the wine was, too, and I got all tipsy and hence started smiling at a frat guy sitting two tables away with one of the fraternities elders. They were from the worst fraternity in town, actually, the most conservative, most radical. They wore the traditional cap and band, and talked loudly enough about frat matters to be easily identified. Had a very entertaining time listening to the chat that guy (strawberryblond, from up north) had with the older man from the fraternity. It's all the same bullshit everywhere, really. The same bullshit, indeed. I really am all fraternity damaged ever since having been with Didi and spending time at that one frat place when I started Uni. Wondered whether they would have talked less loudly if they knew I understood all their code words. Gaaah. It still was fun, on the amount of 1998 Ihringer Fohrenberg Weissherbst trocken I had had. Oh well.  Dad and I went home, where I made the mistake of going online and reading that one post, and got all angry and agitated, but went to 'bed' (on ym air matress, dad got the bed) soon afterwards. Dreamt some bizarre things that circled around having sex with Evan and advice giving on the boards. A later dream circled around my parents, my shrink (whose identity as my shrink wasn't disclosed to my rents of course), and me sitting inside a shop window having dinner and someone in front of the window out to kill me. It was horrid, and sleeping on an inflatable matress really isn't all that relaxing to start with. I have been dreaming odd things lately in general anyway. Lots about Bilstein (and summer camp type places) and looking after people. Wonder where that all comes from. Anyway.  Woke up not really refreshed and early this morn, and after a small breakfast here at my place, Dad and I took off to France at around 9:30am or so. Made our way into Fessenheim, a small village near the river rhine (and the lovely location of the Fessenheim nuclear power plant, conveniently located not only on the only almost volcanic active area in Europe, but also closer to more German than French cities) at about 10:30, and realised the caravane was already there (even though it wasn't scheduled until 11:15 or so). So I missed out on getting a yellow bag from Crediz Lyonnaise again. Duh. It was raining quite heavily, and the main street was still quite empty, until a good while later. Stood at a fabulous spot again, with a great view down the main road, and in a slight curve again. Ended up chatting to some people from Canada, and a group of very funky people from Germany who are now headed to Alp 'd Huez (yeah!). Both had a good time, didn't catch anything good from the caravane, but got a cute official T-Shirt from Dad (that will only be worn at the gym though). The tour finally made it's way into Fessenheim at around 12:15 or so, while it was raining cats'n'dogs and the church bells started ringing. Very funky.  Even though it was just about 20km from the start, a group of 14 riders were a good deal in the front already. Quite impressive. The peloton was already about a minute behind those first chaps, and it was SUCH a great scene, just like I imagined. A rush of colour, and all these bikes, and US Postal leading the peloton with Lance being right in the front of it all, too. Hope the pics I took did turn out well. Oh, the excitement. It was all over rather quickly though (just as we had imagined), and we left France quickly, went through Breisach, the first place on the German side of the Rhine and had a look at the Cathedral and some cake and coffee somewhere, before we dropped the rental car off and spent the rest of the afternoon at home. It was raining so much by that point that any sort of activity outside would really have sucked, so we watched the tour (by that time, the 14 guys in the front were 30 - THIRTY- minutes in front of the peloton) and I almost fell asleep on my floor, even though the tour footage was very interesting and cool. In the end, O'Grady won the yellow jersey back and got the green one, too (which will, due to the rules, be worn by first runner up, Erik Zabel though). All cool. Even though it sure is bizarre that the teams let a bunch of chaps break away and get a distance of 30 minutes on a basically flat stage in the first week of the tour. I really am a little worried that the teams in the Peloton took it too easily in assuming that those 14 guys in the front won't be able to get through the upcoming mountain stages and the mountain time trial. We will see, we will see.  I walked Dad to the train station at around 5ish, and our cool little weekend ended. I hope he enjoyed it, too. :) It really was nice, and next year, we should really go and see one of the mountain stages. We really had a nice father-daughter weekend. Good discussions, two great tour stages, nice food and drink.  Now I am all exhausted and tired and freezing and about to head to bed. Prolly after a little eMail to Ev. Will still stay away from the boards, I think though....tomorrow morn with an AAS forum filled to the brim is coming soon enough. Tomorrow shall be spend with Yoga, getting tons of stuff to the laundromat and studying some more. Oh, the excitement of a normal Monday.  Off for today.

67,67,216413,0,26,"       thanks to phil, who runs  urlLink ttensuppe experience , my day improved by a few hundred percent this afternoon. gracious person that he is, he provided me with an mp3 of 'die waffe' by nationalgalerie, which has been running non stop on my winamp ever since the download was complete.  now let me explain why this leaves me all excited and emotional (which is not solely due to the alcohol consumed at the laundromat today).  i've been looking for this song for years, remembering it faintly, never being able to find it online, the cd long unavailable in the shops, the one person i was sure owned the cd not exactly the person i would ever approach to ask for a tape.  until this afternoon, i had only ever heard the song -at least consciously- once before, at a party in august 1994, totte's 19th birthday party, a week or so after our friend stephan's funeral, which had taken place at totte's actual birthday.  it was a strange party, that one. how can you party when someone you've spend your entire summer with had just been buried? how can you party when there are so many things that had been left unsaid?  we, our summer group of friends, tried, but we couldn't really, if i remember it correctly. i remember that totte had purchased the cheapest beer available for the party, partly to discourage party crasher turning up for free booze. it was indeed horrible beer ( urlLink 'oettinger' ), yet it served the purpose: we got drunk, somewhow.   i also remember that hardly anyone danced that night, in the disco cellar of the youth center of our church, where i would have my 'almost 18' goodbye party before leaving to new zealand roughly two years later, too.  i remember having to leave relatively early, that night, not that i remember why. so i went downstairs, to where totte and his friend volker had been playing their kind of music - to hardly anyone in the room all night, to say goodbye. almost everyone had sat upstairs, drinking, talking casually about nothing in particular, eating the fabulous vegetarian food totte had provided. i had just wanted to say goodbye, but when i came into the dj booth to do just that, totte told me to just stay for one more song, and that's when he put on nationalgalerie's 'die waffe'. i had listened to their album  urlLink 'indiana'  for much of the summer, not getting 'ruhe vor dem sturm' out of my head, so i instantly recognised niels frevert's voice, and we danced and jumped around, totte and me, just the two of us, quite wildly, too, him singing along to the song, that august night in the downstairs disco of the youth centre.  when the song was over, it was time for me to say goodbye, and i said goodbye, and we hugged, for the first time since the day we had found out about stephan's death, i think, holding on to each other for several minutes, him telling me to stay longer. i can still remember what it felt like, that hug. so much had been upside down and inside out in the previous months and weeks and days, and the only thing i felt like was holding on to him and what i felt for him. i was still all head over heels in love with him, still thought it would all work out in the end, somehow. which it didn't. how good you rarely know these things in advance. we rested, the two of us, in this hug, as we did every time we touched each other, which we didn't on a regular basis from a certain point on, always asking the other whether it was okay to hug, always my defences breaking down when we agreed, often attempting to kiss him, which we would't do again until the night of his accident a few weeks later. looking back, knowing that he is sorry he backed out of this, it seems to me as if we were holding on to each other back then hoping to preserve the moment to change it. we weren't together, after all. if both hoping that we were.  and now i am listening to the song again, for the first time in more than 8 years. i am well aware that part of my response to this song is due to the anticipation, to the searching out and tracking down and to my cyclic melancholic looking back on my first love ever.  it's good to have the song now. i can reclaim it as a part of my memories of that summer, i can enjoy it and listen to it, and dance and be sad and happy and let it go,  once i feel like doing so. meeting totte two years ago and talking about our relationship and hearing that he wished it had been different enabled me to make peace with the way things had been and not constantly ponder  we could have been so good together  anymore. once my anger about  the things that migth have been  had subsided, i could accept and let go of it a little more.  and now this awesome, energetic, passionate song is just one more way of remembering what was that night, that summer, and of course it's a way to remember what could have been, too. but it's just that, the trigger to some good memories and some bad memories, a damn good song. it's nothing that throws me off the rails into hours of sadness and wonder about how stupid and young i was at 16.  the song is too good to ruin it by attaching bad, sad memories to it. after all, the feeling i had that night at the party, despite stephan's death just days before, was too good, too. sure, i was terribly and utterly devastated, but this party was, in a way, our way to reclaim a sense of normalcy after the mourning and burying. and i was in love, head over heels, and for the first time for real, i felt safe with totte and i was hopeful and positive about what would develop. all in a way that's only possible the first time it ever happens.  and that's something i really don't want to forget. ever.

77,77,216413,0,26,"       i have a severe case of birthday hangover. or something.  i am tired after all these birthday celebrations, tired because of the heat, annoyed because the parents will be here this weekend and my flat isn't clean enough to abide by my mothers standards, tired, too, because i haven't had a day for myself in ages. annoyed, too, because i am in pain from a bike crash that happened monday morning on the way to the hiv testing (that's what you get for wanting to hold hands while cycling. lesson learned.). i sure look like i've been beaten up, so bad is the bruising on my leg and the scraping on my knees. - it's so bad that walking, sitting, sleeping hurts. jack is coming to visit tonight, for the next day and a half, and while that's great, after everything that's happened, i am already sorry because he'll see such a grumpy, annoyed me.  it's all been well though, really, i am just severely low on energy now, and need rest and lone time, and a cool drink, too.  last night, i went to silke's little birthday bash, which was fabulous. she had it themed -  'arabian nights' - and everyone was dressed colourful and fun. it was a wonderful get together on her large balcony, with plenty of interesting people, and plenty of interesting talk. i found myself in deep talk about yoga with harilal, who is leaving for india next weekend, thanking him again for the workshop and what it did to me. i also ended up in deep talk about life and changes and my 'favourite emotions' with amoth, a friend of ralph & silke's. excellent stuff, really. i also chatted to ann-kathrin, markus wife, who nearly died of hellp syndorme and an assortment of other severe complications (kidney fauilure, necrosis of the liver, severe infections later on) after giving birth to their first son three months ago. she's a wonderful, fantastic woman, and their child is absolutely breathtakingly beautiful and adorable. it was a really good, enjoyable evening. - i cycled home past one am, barefoot, happy and tired, enjoying the brief ride through the city.  my birthday on monday was fine, too: beautiful, sun, champagne, love and rigo filled day, followed by late night talking and a short night at dirk's. - it was the best in years, i'd say.  dirk came over late sunday night, and we sat outside and talked and when it was midnight i unpacked the remaining pressie from the rents (the harry i'd been reading already, and i got a hairdryer i had wished for). dirk gave me an highly personal present, that got me absolutely smitten. the little box is sitting on my desk now, right here next to my computer, and i keep opening it, looking at its contents, holding them, feeling them, admiring them. they might look like nothing to an outsider, the little things in there, but having heard their stories, they mean a lot. no money in the world can buy a present like this. wow.  monday morning, after the bike crash, we went to the health department, which was a funny experience, overall, even though i was quite surprised how little pre-test counselling they gave. it's a week till the results, and i am also surprised by how unworried i am this time around, at least about the hiv. my blood was very light on colour again, and so i am concerned about low hb again. guess i should head to the blood bank again, to donate and see what it's like, my hb. oy. after the blood testing, dirk took me out to brekkie, right downstairs at uc, which was a lovely little luxury. afterwards, we went to the laundromat, where dieter and marco openend a bottle of champagne on me, and fun was had by all. alcohol in above 30 weather, in the middle of the day, has funny effects.  after some exhausted napping and a funky phone call by  urlLink jens , dirk and i headed out on the bikes for a half an hour ride to a lake recommended by dieter in the afternoon. it was lovely: great water, great location, few people. we swam (pretty much) naked again (i am turning into a nudist one of these days, i swear - but it feels so much nicer to be in the water without a bikini...and i must admit that i've never seen anything prettier than naked dirk coming out of a lake. yum.), were lying around reading mags and harry potter and having rigos and watermelon. a very simple, very lovely kind of fun. in the evening, after a nap and a shower, we cooked dinner and ate on the balcony, i made the dough for jamie oliver choc chip cookies for silke, and we rode to dirk's place. i baked the cookies, he packed for his school trip (coming home tomorrow), and we talked late, about important stuff, outlooks on life. it pushed some of my buttons though, that talk, and made me feel low, unable to pin down the exact reason that caused my low-ness. it was still there when i woke up tuesday morning, still there when we said goodbye before he hurried off to the train station for his trip, and little bits of it are still here, as i type this. i talked to evan, too, yesterday, and that re-enforced some of that strange feeling as well. i told him that i am seeing someone, and he got very upset, telling me the break-up was all because of me, that he was replacable and obviously never meant much to me and giving me the usual mindfuck about me making all the rules and being pushy and yadayadayada.  it upsets me that i am *still* gloomy, because all should be fine and dandy and cool, because all is fine and dandy and cool. it is summer. i am in love.  what else do i want? what else do i need?  i hate it, how these old issues keep creeping up, once a week, just because, sparked by stuff i still can't really identify. i think i will take up amoth's offer and talk about them with him again.  one thing amazed me: i told dirk monday night, in our deep discussion, how things are rarely black or white for me, but many many shades of grey instead. evan, on the other hand, just 10 hours or so later, accused me of seeing everything as either black and white.  strange, really. i am realising i spend three years with someone neither knowing him, nor being known by him. how strange. how sad.         ",5257,1000,i have a severe case of birthday hangover or something i am tired after all these birthday celebrations tired because of the heat annoyed because the parents will be here this weekend and my flat isn't clean enough to abide by my mothers standards tired too because i haven't had a day for myself in ages annoyed too because i am in pain from a bike crash that happened monday morning on

interesting talk i found myself in deep talk about yoga with harilal who is leaving for india next weekend thanking him again for the workshop and what it did to me i also ended up in deep talk about life and changes and my favourite emotions with amoth a friend of ralph silke's excellent stuff really i also chatted to ann-kathrin markus wife who nearly died of hellp syndorme and an assortment of other severe complications kidney fauilure necrosis of the liver severe infections later on after giving birth to their first son three months ago she's a wonderful fantastic woman and their child is

84,84,470861,1,27,"                 WHAT UP???   Ironically, it is 10:50pm and I just walked in the door from Penelope's house.  Um? I used to go over there and spend like 2 hours and bolt and now I just can't leave.  We had an awesome time.  We played the ever so popular 'question game' and we laughed, smoked, drank, whatever.  It is very rare that I think I overstay my welcome.  If I run into a situation where I want to stay, but feel I should leave, I will ask over and over 'I should go.  Right?'.  But Penelope seemed to enjoy me staying so I did.  In fact, when her brother Ethan started dying of hunger, I felt like she still wanted me to stay.  We just had so much fun.  It was chill.  It was cool.  It was exactly what I needed today.  I had a good time.  Scratch that.  I had a wonderful time.  Bitch need to get an air conditioner though.  SO KIDDING!  Kelly and I lived in a no air conditioner house during the worst weeks of the summer and we felt awful when visitors came.  But to be honest...fuck the visitors...who cares what they think!  You got to LIVE in that sauna.  Who gives a shit what visitors feel when they come down...they get to go home later!   So yeah... I had such an amazing time.  We talked about movies, actors/actresses, Dawson's Creek, V, damn...I went over there feeling like shit.  Cuz I HADN'T shit all day...and then I dumped the minute I got there and life just got better.   Did I really just say that? Did I really just say 'And then I dumped the minute I got there'?  Someone remind me that I am gay and that I have more class than that. I thought that I might run into Kelly tonight.  She was supposed to be home around 11pm and it is about that time now.  I figured she would shit herself if she saw me up and milling about at the wee hours of the morning.  (10:30pm) So...big weekend coming up.  Jessica will be here on Friday.  I am excited and curious at the same time.  We have never had Ryan AND Jessica for a visit since we moved to NYC.  Never has happened.  It is going to be interesting.  Kelly doesn't know Ryan very well...and Penelope don't know either of them at all...but they will both see how Creepsville this whole situation is.  Ryan is hard to explain.  He gives you the creeps, but you can't EXACTLY pin point why.  He will hit on you, cuz that is just his way.  Don't matter if you are gay or straight, black or blue, Jewish or Hindu, the kid will make you feel as though when he says: 'How are you?', you hear: 'May I eat your cunt?'.  It's all very bizarre, but it will ring true if you meet him. Side note... The cab I took home smelled like curry diarehea.  I don't remember how to spell diarehhea.  It really smelled like that.  BADLY.  Then at some points, I smelled an exceptional amount of fart mixed in with the curry. My Deduction----- This cab driver ate a curry dinner at the beginning of his shift.  When I jumped in, he was at the brink of bursting into horrible bouts of cramps and intestinal chaos.  I smelled his dinner and his aftermath in the air...and I was horrified. The worst part about it.... I sit here typing and smell it on my clothes. DO I HAVE TO TAKE A FUCKING SHOWER NOW?  Bullshit! man i stink. So, Jessica coming is a big event.  She is a great visitor.  We will laugh, we will talk, and it will remind Rita and I of the old days.  And I think we are due.  The exceptionally strange part of it is that Jessica never mentioned calling Stacey while she was here.  I guess that friendship is done. I just heard  the door slam.  Is Kelly home???? I think so... I wait in anticipation to shock the shit out of her that I am awake still..... Waiting..... waiting.................. still think I might hear her........ Nope, I don't think it is her. Anyhoodle...I wonder if anyone will go this far down in today's entry and read all this.  Once you get past the first scrolldown, I find that people give up on you.  That's ok.  Cuz deepdown, writing in this journal gives me this crazy sense of purpose.  It's like a project and even when I don't want to do it, I do.  I feel like I should commit to it or nothing.  I am sure, someday soon, I will lose it.  And once I lose it, it's done.  Somewhat like what Rita did.  Except that I will leave my page up to represent the legacy that was Joe CuttheShit.  HAHAHAHAHAHAHA yeah. So Edward is coming to visit in May.  UM?!?!?!?  Motha fuckers....please sit me down before his visit and ask me how important it is that his and my time go well. Edward is my unrequited love.  I loved.  He was straight.  But we made out.  We slept in the same bed together, me holding him in my arms.  He  is first and foremost a friend.  But...he is the only guy that I have ever  questioned Paul for.  There was Ian...but that was flingish.  Stupid sex.  And not worth it by any means.  Edward...he is someone I fell for.  Someone, that in SOME ways, I obsessed over.  Why?  He is not my type.  He is straight and he is exactly what I am NOT looking for in a future 'husband'.   There are two people in my life that I will always wonder about....or at least at this point in my life always wonder about... Edward is one...and there is another.  The other is even more dangerous.  It is somebody that, if it worked, would change the entire person I call Joe CuttheShit.   But Edward is someone that I always wonder about a lot more frequently.  One time, Rita and I went to this psychic.  It could have been better, but we all found ourselves finding out something that has stuck with us forever.  Or at least I did.  The psychic said that, since I was a Cancer and I love hard, I will have three major loves in my life.  Oh...and that I will be successful in my chosen career.  But don't those bitches always say that?   So three loves.... The first love,  I question,....in my mind, it was always BJ.  I thought he was the guy that I would spend the rest of my life with.  There was nothing that could ever change the bond that he and I had.  It was the first all consuming love experience that  I have ever had.  And now...we don't speak at all. And it wasn't a relationship by any justifiable terms.  So was he my first?  I think probably.  I fell for him hard.  So it counts, right? Paul is the second.  Paul, like  BJ, is NOTHING that I EVER thought I would fall for.  But I did.  And once again, hard.  But different hard.  So different.  I remember Kelly and I sitting in the parking lot of the Guilderland Library and me sobbing to her that I needed him.  That something inside of me needed to be with HIM.  Kelly, having experienced me not like any guy I dated, and always breaking up with EVERYONE, was the person who gave me my geared me towards a relationship with Paul.  We changed our weekend plans of going to NYC that weekend and ended up going back to Boston so that I could figure things out with Paul.  Man.  She has done some incredible things for me.  Things that no one has ever done.  She has EARNED a place in my heart that could never and WILL never be forgotten or filled.  Kelly believes in me and always has.  She brought me to Paul, thus bringing in my second love.   SO!  LONG TANGENT short....or still kind of long...do I have a third left?  Is Paul my life partner?  Is he my final man?  I feel like it could work itself out so that the answer is yes, but....I still feel something missing.   Will my third combine body AND soul?  Not so much body, but a physical something that I would die for?  I feel like that is one of the biggest things holding Paul and I back.  I just don't get as excited over him as I want to be.  SUPRISE FOLKS!  I am not a virgin just because I am trying to make it special....he won't let go completely with me.  THAT holds up back from crossing over into the anal.   WOW. So...there is all this shit.  I find myself dwelling and dwelling unecessarily about it 300 times a day.  I try not to overdue it with my close peeps, cuz who wants to hear that shit all the time?  But some days are definitely harder than others.  Last week, life was fucking grand and all things seemed hunky dory.  (I fucking hate hunky dory as a saying)  But this week...all REALLY GREAT...but the Paul problems are becoming increasingly harder to bear.  I said last week that he and I haved moved to another level.  We have.  But now there are different problems to face.  And above it all...I just keep loving him more.  It is so scary not to be able to just stop it.  I am so used to playing the game and getting what I want.  I always get what I want.  :( But when it counts, when it is Paul and my whole relationship, I don't get anything that I want.  It is a lesson I have to learn and live with every day.  I HATE LONG DISTANCE to begin with.  I always told myself  'NO!.  That could never work.'  And her I am.  Having it work, but having it be the hardest thing that I have ever done in my entire life.  Paul and I spent 6 months living in the same area.  6 FUCKING MONTHS!  That's it!  We have been together 2 years and 3 months.  And we are still kicking.  I try to be proud.  But I have never known a whole week, a full 7 days, of the feeling 'I have a boyfriend that I love.'  I have had long weekends.  I have had 6 days in a row.  Once or twice before.  But I don't know what it is like to get sick of my boyfriend.  I don't know what it is like to want him 'to go out with his friends and me go out with my friends'.   It chokes me  up.  I had much higher expectations for this.  And after 2 years, the arguement is still:'When are you going to move near me?'   Deep down I truly want him to do what he wants.  I respect every decision he makes because I truly respect him.  Paul is someone that I look up to and want to be.  He is my perfect balance.  He is good at things that I am bad at and vice versa.  We fit like a puzzle.   Because I believe this so truly that I have stayed with him this long, I really wonder what it would be like for us to be together full time.  Would it  work?  Could it work?  Are we a REAL couple?  Or are we just a fantasy that we have been trying so desparately to live?  If he actually moved here, would I still love him just the same?  Gosh.  The question that breaks my head open.  I just don't know.  I don't push him into moving.  I whine, like a bitch sometimes, but I don't put any pressure on him.  Maybe I have a couple times...but it hasn't been an issue anyway.  But deep down...I am dying.  If Mariah moves and he has a bad roommate, I can't go visit.  Especially if he has to work one of the nights.  And if he visits me and Mariah in NYC at the same time...I can't handle that.  It will really hurt.  I will never make it a problem, but it will crush me.   So all of this...and you know what??? fucking enough. This has been a wonderfully introspective evening.  The weather makes me so happy I want to cry.  Thank G-d for Penelope.  (Look...I left out the 'O' for you so that you wouldn't have to bury this entry.) I hope everyone feels good.

92,92,470861,1,27,"                 So here I am, in Albany.  I have had the worst migraine since I walked in the door last night.  I spent about 2 hours vomiting all the food I DIDN'T eat today and then held my head and rocked back and forth until about 4am.  I finally got some sleep and was up at 10am this morning with the same damn headache.  I did everything I could to make it go away.  I masturbated, took a hot shower, smoked a  bowl, and then finally bit the bullet and bought some Excedrin Migraine pills at CVS.  After this, my parents and I went to the theater to see  Changing Lanes .  Not awful, but not recommendable.  Ben Affleck was suprisingly adorable and I did have a good time.  About half way through the movie, the headache ceased and I have been getting increasingly better.  I now just have the dull ache and hopefully can move forward and have a good rest of the time with my parents. I came to Albany for two reasons.  One was to see my mother on Mother's Day.  The other was to go to a neutral place and try to clear my head.  Leaving Boston yesterday was one of the hardest goodbyes that I have had in a long while.   To say the absolute least, my last 9 days have been full of stress, heartache, frustration, fear, and ironically some beautiful moments.  I will never forget all of what happened.  I have images that will stay with me forever.   When I first got to Boston, Paul was wonderful.  He was in good spirits, was incredibly excited to have me there helping him out.  On Thursday we walked around Boston and spent the majority of the day doing some food shopping, Mother's Day shopping, and visiting friends.  Friday was just as good; hanging out with Mariah and the baby, doing some more shopping, and just feeling great.  Around 11pm, as I was doing the dressing change on Paul, I noticed that the hole (this unbelievably LARGE hole) was turning black in some areas.  His pain was starting to get much worse and his spririts crashed.  During the day Saturday, his pain and temperature started to rise.  I started to panic.  When I took his last temperature reading, it was at 104 and I knew that I had to get him to the emergency room as quickly as I could.   We were in the emergency room for about 6 or 7 hours that night and they cleaned him up, brought the fever down, and foolishly sent us home.  On Sunday, the hole was COMPLETELY covered in black and I immediately rushed him to the emergency room again with a fever hovering around 103. We spent the night in the hospital that night.  Me sleeping horribly in the waiting room, Paul cooped up in some hospital bed all alone.  I wasn't even allowed to stay with him.  AND they kept us in the damn emergency waiting room for about 2 hours before they even took him in.   He was so brave.  Such a good patient and said 'thank you' and 'I love you' at every possible moment.  I called work, explained the situation, and ended up staying even longer.  Tuesday afternoon, it was back to the emergency room.  At  this point, Paul's pain was so intense that he was screaming, crying, and scaring the shit out of me.  Upon this visit to the emergency room, Paul spent two nights in the hospital, racking up more bills and keeping me sleeping in 2 hour increments.  It was hard.   They cleaned his hole out, gave him some sort of preventative infection prescription, and debated whether or not to seal up his gaping hole.  They ended up not doing anything about it. I missed my dinner, I missed a full week of work, and on top of all of this, I feel like I missed a whole week of my life.  As good of a feeling as it was to take care of my baby and to make sure that he was ok at every moment, I never felt so lonely in all my life.  Maybe it's Karma.  I don't know. I cleaned the house, did laundry about every day, did all of the food shopping, all prescription filling, most bandage changes, helped him shit, bathe, eat, get through the pain, etc.  It was exhausting.   I must admit that I kept my attitude positive.  I grew closer to him than ever before and I finally took care of him the way he has always taken care of me.   So many thing went running through my mind last week.  I thought about what it must be like for couples with AIDS and how hard it is to face that disease as one's future.  At least with this scenario, I was always pretty confident that he would eventually get better.  After a week of taking care of someone as though they were as incompetent as an infant, I realized that I don't have what it takes to take care of anyone but myself. I realized how selfish I really am.  How unfortunate and unacceptable this is.  I feel like in a lot of ways, I have become a cynical, mean person.  I used to be so kind.  So approachable, so proud to be sensitive and available.  I am more closed off to my personal life now than I have ever been before and it doesn't feel good at all. Taking care of Paul.... Knowing that it was one year ago this week that Kelly's mom was fighting for her life in the hospital... Seeing and feeling how precious life is and how little time we all have... Having to sacrifice everything I wanted for a week for someone I loved... Realizing in some ways that I have strength in me to do things I never thought I could do... The whole experience was very surreal.   I am scared to go back home.   It has been 9 days since I have been in NYC.  Once out of the place for an extended period, it is hard to get excited about jumping back in.   I feel like the challenges that lay before me are so great that I will never climb out of it.  I feel tired and I feel beaten down.  In no way was the last week and a half rejuvenating, nor did it help me to get a more idealistic perspective on my current situation.  I feel uneasy about going home.   When things get tough I shut people out.  I find it hard to ask for help.  And after the way I have been over the last couple of months, it was even more difficult for me to reach out to the people I love, because I wasn't there when they reached out.   Man, I don't know.  I have two girls waiting for me at home that I love so dearly.  That are always there for me and were there for me last week, in prayers and thoughts if not in the physical sense.  I have a friend at work that I love dearly as well, that looked after me while I was gone and missed having me in the chair next to her, I hope.  I don't have much in NYC.  But what I do have I cherish.  It is hard for me to show this because I feel very stressed and frustrated with my current standing as a wannabe actor in NYC.  What I have to remind myself of is that all of my friends are in the same position.  We are all struggling with who we are and what we want out of life, yet forced to race against time to complete it all.   If I realize that we are all in the same place, why I am trying to control it all?  Why do I feel the need to be the leader?  Why do I force people to fit in with my view of life and it's complications?   And most of all...how do I change this realization so that I can emerge with my old self confidence while still having the love, support, and respect of those I need most?   I am scared to leave Paul alone.  I talked to him this morning and his parents never came to see him.  That hurt.  That hurt alot.  But he is strong with it and I am sure in a lot of ways is the reason for them not coming to be with him.  Yet, I come from a family that I would give my life for and that would do the same for me...so why didn't they come anyway?  Did they at any point realize how serious this whole situation was?   Why was I the only one at the hospital?  Why was I the only one taking him to the clinic, the hospital, the fucking bathroom?   Paul felt so insecure about losing his position at work, that he didn't even tell them that he was in and out of the hospital all week.  Trying to hide this fact from those that did call was difficult, if not upsetting.  You would think that these people would try to get him back on his feet, not steal his shifts right from under him.  And then not even ask how he was really doing. Wow...so much in my head.  Some bitterness, some fear, alot of sadness, and absolutely no self-confidence.  But I feel like, with rock bottom comes a new beginning.  I have to change my life.  Immediately.   I am ready to grow again.  I am ready to expand, love my friends, work on my patience level, and begin anew.   That is if I don't get fired from my job.  Then I will be spending all of my time looking through the want ads. I am grateful for my housemates, my co-workers, and my family.  Without which I think I would collapse and spend a long time trying to bounce back.   I am going home tomorrow.  I will be ready by the time it happens. That was the whole reason of coming home now wasn't it?   I want more and to get that...I am going to have to give it. If nothing else, the main thing I learned this week is about how to be generous.  How to be patient.  How to love unconditionally and how to sacrifice.  This is a lesson I need to re-learn.   I need to be this way every day.  Not just when my loved ones lose everything.               ",5108,1000,So here I am in Albany I have had the worst migraine since I walked in the door last night I spent about hours vomiting all the food I DIDN'T eat today and then held my head and rocked back and forth until about am I finally got some sleep and was up at am this morning with the same damn headache I did everything I could to make it go away I masturbated took a hot shower smoked a bowl and then finally bit the bullet and bought some Excedrin Migraine pills at CVS After this my parents and I went to the theater to see Changing Lanes Not awful but not recommendable Ben Affleck was suprisingly adorable and I did have a good time About half way through the movie the headache ceased and I have been getting increasingly better I now just have the dull ache and hopefully can move forward and have a good rest of the time with my parents I came to Albany for two reasons One was to see my mother on Mother's Day The other was to go to a neutral place and try to clear my head Leaving Boston yesterday was one of the hardest goodbyes that I have had in a long while To say the absolute least my last days have been full of stress heartache frustration fear and ironically some beautiful moments I will never forget all of what happened I have images that will stay with me forever When I first got to Boston Paul was wonderful He was in good spirits was incredibly excited to have me there helping him out On Thursday we walked around Boston and spent the majority of the day doing some food shopping Mother's Day shopping and visiting friends Friday was just as good hanging out with Mariah and the baby doing some more shopping and just feeling great Around pm as I was doing the dressing change on Paul I noticed that the hole this unbelievably LARGE hole was turning black in some areas His pain was starting to get much worse and his spririts crashed During the day Saturday his pain and temperature started to rise I started to panic When I took his last temperature reading it was at and I knew that I had to get him to the emergency room as quickly as I could We were in the emergency room for about or hours that night and they cleaned him up brought the fever down and foolishly sent us home On Sunday the hole was COMPLETELY covered in black and I immediately rushed him to the emergency room again with a fever hovering around We spent the night in the hospital that night Me sleeping horribly in the waiting room Paul cooped up in some hospital bed all alone I wasn't even allowed to stay with him AND they kept us in the damn emergency waiting room for about hours before they even took him in He was so brave Such a good patient and said thank you and I love you at every possible moment I called work explained the situation and ended up staying even longer Tuesday afternoon it was back to the emergency room At this point Paul's pain was so intense that he was screaming crying and scaring the shit out of me Upon this visit to the emergency room Paul spent two nights in the hospital racking up more bills and keeping me sleeping in hour increments It was hard They cleaned his hole out gave him some sort of preventative infection prescription and debated whether or not to seal up his gaping hole They ended up not doing anything about it I missed my dinner I missed a full week of work and on top of all of this I feel like I missed a whole week of my life As good of a feeling as it was to take care of my baby and to make sure that he was ok at every moment I never felt so lonely in all my life Maybe it's Karma I don't know I cleaned the house did laundry about every day did all of the food shopping all prescription filling most bandage changes helped him shit bathe eat get through the pain etc It was exhausting I must admit that I kept my attitude positive I grew closer to him than ever before and I finally took care of him the way he has always taken care of me So many thing went running through my mind last week I thought about what it must be like for couples with AIDS and how hard it is to face that disease as one's future At least with this scenario I was always pretty confident that he would eventually get better After a week of taking care of someone as though they were as incompetent as an infant I realized that I don't have what it takes to take care of anyone but myself I realized how selfish I really am How unfortunate and unacceptable this is I feel like in a lot of ways I have become a cynical mean person I used to be so kind So approachable so proud to be sensitive and available I am more closed off to my personal life now than I have ever been before and it doesn't feel good at all Taking care of Paul Knowing that it was one year ago this week that Kelly's mom was fighting for her life in the hospital Seeing and feeling how precious life is and how little time we all have Having to sacrifice everything I wanted for a week for someone I loved Realizing in some ways that I have strength in me to do things I never thought I could do The whole experience was very surreal I am scared to go back home It has been days since I have been in NYC,119,test
95,95,470861,1,27,"                 When I was first thinking about moving to NYC, I was under one definite misconception. In Manhattan, not necessarily Queens, I was sure that there were going to be beautiful people on every corner.  Everyone would be wearing the best clothes, have the best style, and they would all be HOTT!  However, this is completely false.  Not only are most people nasty, but the city stinks of poo alot.  And on top of that, I see more homeless men/women then I see Wall Street Bankers.  True, I work nowhere near the Stock Market, so that could account for the minimal number of bankers I see, but still!  Where are my Abercrombie and Fitch models?  Where are my celebrities?  Where are my high profile lawyers?  Do they even exist?  I know they are here somewhere, but hells if I can meet one.   The one thing I didn't count on was how much I was going to love living here.  I have lived in very few, but more than 5 places in my life.  I have never felt the pride that I feel when I say I live in NEW YORK CITY.  There is a definite community here.  There is a reason why tourists swarm the city.  I have lived in New York State my whole life.  Never anywhere else.  But until the last year and a half, I have never felt like a true New Yorker.  I do now.  I am one.  I guess I have always been one, but now I feel like I understand what it means.  It's one thing to say it.  It's another thing to boast it.  But to really feel it...now that is something special.   I feel it very strongly.   I don't think that I am one of these people that will spend my life in the big city.  I definitely have the need to be in California.  But for the time being, I am so happy where I am.  I wouldn't trade this up for anything in the world. It is harder to live here and that sucks sometimes.  Overall, the city is very expensive.  My commute to work is no less than an hour.  I deal with obnoxious people every single day.  And doing little things like my laundry or grocery shopping is more of a hassle than it is worth it.  But deep down I love it.  I have already adapted to it and now I am starting to really enjoy it.  It only took me a year to get to this point.  Not so bad. There is a real community here.  I feel safe on the subways, safe on the streets, safe in most bars, just really quite safe in whatever I do.  I feel protected.  I feel independent.  And I feel more confident than I have ever felt before in my life. I do believe that the city is not for everyone.  Honestly, I don't think the city is right for some of my closest friends.  People have different needs and personalities.  Not everyone is going to adapt in the same way.  But in either case, there is FUN to be had.  There is always something to do.  The city never sleeps.  True, I would prefer having enough money to be comfortable AND to still have a blast...but you can't have it all. So I prefer having a blast. In my opinion, September 11th didn't create New Yorkers.  New Yorkers were always New Yorkers.  But after the disaster, the world woke up to the true definition of what a New Yorker is.  Most people (me included) believed that NY'ers were rude, angry, and only in it for personal achievement and satisfaction.  I was so very wrong.  The people here are definitely aggressive.  They are absolutely here for personal happiness.  They are real.  They are blunt.  And they are allowing me to become exactly like them.  To become exactly what I have always wanted to be. I am by nature the kind of person that doesn't want to step on people's toes.  Ever.  I try to be as nice as I can.  Hurting someone's feelings hurts mine in turn.  In fact, up until a couple of months ago, I had a real problem being honest with the people close in my life.  I was just too afraid to stand up for ME.  I don't like to fight.  I have never been someone who enjoys arguing and I am still not the type of person that will get into a heated debate with someone over anything based on opinion.  As far as I am concerned, you can believe you are right as long as I don't have to agree with you.   NYC is making me stronger.  It is making it so that I have a voice.  I am no longer afraid to tell the people in the subway to 'fuck off'.  I can call my family and friends now and not beg for forgiveness for things I really didn't do.  I am not scared to get into an arguement with my friends because I know that we will be friends forever.  If Penelope and I have a fight at work, she and I can simply walk away and I know it will be fine.  Having a friend means never having to kiss their ass.  And I know this now.  NYC has opened up my eyes and mind.  Being a guy that is always ruled by my heart, it was very difficult to tell anyone in my life that they were screwing up.   Most importantly, I have realized that I am here in this city for me and me alone.  I am here to be an actor.  I am here to grow and to learn.  It is like the education that you never get in college.  The education of how to be a strong, capable adult.  It feels wonderful to know that I am only responsible for me.  It feels so good that I can see the growth.  At 25, I am in a different place than I was at 24, and at 26...25 will seem like childhood.  The one good thing about getting older is the wisdom that goes along with it. NYC is growing me up in a way that no other city has.  I am becoming strong and self-sufficient.  And above all this, I am happier than I have ever been in my life. Last night I spoke on the phone with my dad for almost 2 1/2 hours.  I meant to only call him and catch up with him and the next thing I know we are talking about everything from work to every personal relationship that I have.  Gosh.  The wisdom this man has just blows my mind.  He believes in me and takes my side without being petty.  He supports me unconditionally and he gives me confidence in my decisions.  He is my father and my friend and somehow has managed to find a balance at that.  I asked him the following question: 'How did you know...I mean really KNOW that you were in love with mom?  How did you know that marriage was the next step?' We spoke on this topic for a good hour.  I went into the conversation thinking one thing and was relieved when I walked out of it thinking another.  He and my mom have been married 26 years, so they must be doing something right.  I hope to follow in his same path.  And maybe with Paul.... My dad and I talked about marriage, about children, and about Paul fitting into all of this.  WOW.  It was pretty intense.  But it was perfect.  I wouldn't have changed any part of the conversation.  He invited Paul and I to spend a weekend with them at my house in Albany.  He also invited us to Cape Cod in August and to Provincetown in November.  He invited US.  Just US.  I can't believe it.  The effort he is making is astronomical.  Paul and I will definitely be doing one of these visits, if not all of them.  I want and need them to get to know he and I, as a couple, away from my friends and my brother.  I want them to see why he and I work; why after all the heartache that Paul and I have been through, things are better now than they ever have been.  Being in love isn't just springtime and hearts.  There's definitely a little shit thrown in there too.  But you know you are meant to be if you can deal with the shit and still find that love.  Not just deal with it.  If you can accept it and move forward because of it.  Even more than that.  If you can accept it as partly your fault and know that their are things that you need to do to make it all better.   After the last time that Paul and I broke up, I cried for days.  I missed him.  I was angry at him and said that I needed to be treated better.  I believed that I deserved more and that he was destroying me as a person.   I am so glad that my maturity stepped in and that I realized that a relationship is a two-way street.  Nothing more, nothing less.  I could have never took my step down and Paul and I never would be where we are today.  The last 4 months with him have been better than the 2 years before it.  I would have missed out on him growing as well.  I am so glad that I didn't make this mistake.  And now, my parents fully want a part of him and above everything else, that makes me feel the best.  I AM IN LOVE and I am happy.  God. I never thought those words would ever be in the same sentence.  And they are.  And it is honest.  And what a relief.   This entry has gone in a million directions today.  I have been typing it for hours it seems.  I do think they are all correlated and together they make the full picture.   Here is my thesis statement:  Family, friends, and boyfriend, do not make you the person you want to be.  They can assist in guiding you down the right path, but the responsibility of growing up and accepting the consequences of your actions is all your own.

96,96,470861,1,27,"                 So wow.   Everything is changing right before my eyes. I mean, I know that with this journal I am notorious for saying that things are changing and that I am due for some sort of comeback within my life.   But I feel like this time its for real. I know this sounds stupid, but I work at the Gap.  I mean, Joe Cuttheshit works at the Gap.   Joe Cuttheshit doesnt work at the Gap.  Joe Cuttheshit doesnt work a second job period. But here I am...trying my best to guide my life into a healthier direction.  A life filled with no booze, no slack time, and no life that isnt anything, but productive.   Tonight was my one night off.  I am sort of understanding how Kelly feels when she has to work every single night knowing that she can only see her roommates once a week or so... Weird, cuz before I didnt get that and now I kinda do.   Last night, when I found out that I wouldnt have to work this evening, I thought FUCKING YES!  I can get drunk with Rita and not feel guilty for doing it!  I can earn my night of drinking instead of relying on it. You see... I dont think that I am addicted ( you could get...addicted ) to alcohol; I think I am addicted to the feeling I get hanging out with my friends while having a few beers on the table.   Going into tonight, I knew that this was my night to drink.  I knew deep down that it couldnt be CRAZY and go all night because its a Thursday and there is  work  to do tomorrow, but at the same time, I looked forward to tonight as though it was my own personal weekend. I have to work at my day job tomorrow and at the Gap for just about all of Friday and Saturday.   I am used to having one night watching movies and one night going out on the town. Wow.  Everythings changing. I had the most amazing time with Rita tonight.  We discussed some very personal issues that are plaguing both of our otherwise perfect lives.  Lots of shit has been going on with the three housemates lately and none of it is journal business at this point.  Eventually I will spill the beans, but for now, the three of us are really finding ourselves in not only the city, but in our personal lives as well.   We are learning, very gradually, what our purpose is in this great big world.  I know  it sounds lame, but it is so tragically true.  I count on the fact that those who read my journal understand that this is a journal and that there is so much more going on behind the scenes.  Its focused on what I see in my every day life as well as how I feel feel expressing myself on that given day. So I have just inundated you with non-sequential bullshit, but I think that you understand my freeverse. tangent. whatever. I love my Rita.  In a way that would make a grown man cry.  A big hairy trucker grown man even. I dont wax philosophic nearly enough about her.   At this point in my life, I find myself as a cojoined twin. Siamese baby if you will. Rita and I work together, come home together, go out together, have the same friends, watch movies together, buy underwear together, and even call out the fact that we are at that moment taking our daily shit. Its a little bizarre and somewhat cartoonish at the same time. I am constantly writing in here about the levels that Kelly and I are conquering, yet Rita remains a complete mystery.  All that is ever said is that she is funny and likes BBQ and got me hooked on this journal.   But in all reality, she is ties it all together. Kelly and Rita serve very different purposes in my life. Kelly knows me in one way and Rita knows me in another. Both of them are one of 8 people that mean the world to me.  8 people that comprise my entire existence on this planet.  If all of them were to die in some freak ridiculous accident, I would be forced to kill my own person, because I would have no one. I dont think I need to explain who these people are, because that would make this even that much more staged and cliche, but I do need to say that yes Ari, I consider you one of these 8 people. ***DISCLAIMER---IF YOU ARE NOT ARI FEEL FREE TO SLIP THIS PART ENTIRELY*** You are my NYC life.  At least at this point.  I know you and I have thus begun to understand you.  You have taught me so much about myself that I couldnt begin to thank you.  You and I have that relationship where we hate and love eachother so intensely.  We dont fight, but when we do its scathing, no matter how it happens.  Yet, as personal as these moments get, I find myself talking about you and explaining who you are to people that dont even know you.  You are a huge part of my life and I am so glad tht I have gotten to the point (regardless of age and all of our other society based stipulations) where I truly know who you  are .  You amaze me.  I see through that hard exterior.  You know I do.  I happened to be talking about you with Rita tonight, as I often do...and I realized once again how integral the part you play in my life really is. So whatever snores.  Thank you.  You are one of the 8.   Please love it. ***DISCLAIMER OVER! DONT ACT LIKE AN ASSHOLE, I TOLD YOU IT WAS FOR ARI!*** All of my friends serve this incredibly important function in my life. I just wanted to highlight Rita tonight.   She started me on this journal.  I read hers before she even got here.  She allowed me to actually experience it. Cuz see, with Rita...it was never about the site meter.   It was about the love of writing. I have tried to put a guest book and comments on my page and while I think that that is totally appropriate for some journals, based on the writers purpose, I dont think it is right for mine. Rita taught me to write for me and as much as I dont think that I open up nearly enough in here, I have sessions of writing where I find myself pouring out my soul.   So Rita has been the influence of this particular journal. This girl just gets me.   She looks at me directly in the eye and before I can even conceptualize the thought of having a bad day, she says to me: Are you alright? And I fucking hate that! I always respond with Yes.  Are YOU alright? Then 20 minutes later I am down and out in my so called Beverly Hills life and I say 'Fine, I suck today.'. She just knows. She gives great advice, she has a great laugh, and she is the first person that I have spent 18 hours a day with, every day, and never bores me.   Tonight, for example, we came home knowing that we were having wine...despite the fact that she battled a headache and post -Billy Blanks Tai Bo - recovery all day.  Shes crazy.   She also ate an entire bag of Haribo Raspberries today and felt so physically nautious and full of guilt that every sentence began with Hi, I ate all of the raspberries in my special bag, um...sorry bout that....do you want me to fax that donor opportunity to the president of the board. Seriously, she made herself ill.  And I laughed all day. As quoted by Rita in an email around 11am this morning: Joe, I made a mistake.  I bought a bag of Haribo Raspberries and ate the entire thing just now.  Forgive me baby Jesus.  I just ate em and ate em and now I am sick.  So I laugh and think:  'You weigh 17 ounces and need to have this experience every morning before 11am.  Wait...'You ate that entire bag before 11am?' hahahha please I drink a bottle of pepsi on my way to my shower. BTW...Kelly has been swimming alot lately and has really huge biceps. No, I am not kidding. They are better than mine. Um...do I want Kelly cuz she is a bodybuilder? interesting... So yeah...I started this thing wanting to say how great Rita is and instead I go on and on about how shes ridiculous. hahahahaha oh. BTW...why am I hahahahaing all the time now.  Its not like I am sitting in my chair and literally hahahahahahaing?  As Rita says:  Stop writing to me in your fake ass emoticon faces. Okay, she never said it like that (cuz we are polite middle class citizens), but the point was taken. A couple months ago we created nicknames. Hers in Ladle and Mine is Boobie. I know its strange and doesnt make sense, but to us, when it is said...it does.  It really does. Everythings okay if its: Goodnight Boobie and in response Goodnight Ladle. Truthfully. I am totally satisfied and in some ways personally moved by how wonderful my weekend was. I had tonight and Rita made it the best. We got home at 6pm and sat in front of the television, without it even turned on, and talked for 4 straight hours. Then she had to go to bed. Just talked. My housemates are bomb.  They really are.  They are my best friends in the world and I defintiely couldnt have asked for a better people to share this time with.   While we all struggle and fall...these are the people that are going to pick you up and (sometimes literally) put you back on your feet. I am lucky. Gosh, after all this, how can I ever write about my life being shit?

99,99,470861,1,27,"                 So, it's been awhile huh?  That is an understatement when I stop to respond to all of the nasty emails I got from you people's.  Look, I was just taking some time off!  (WINKLES!)  If I haven't written back to you yet, hold up, I will.   Gosh, there is so much to cover, I don't know where to start.  I guess I should begin with venting...since right now I feel like I am going to rip someone's face off.  You know?  I just hate having my feathers ruffled so early in the morning.  But it does happen and then I get all crazy inside like I wanna kill someone.   There were a total of 3 things that drove me up the fucking wall this morning... I will explain one of them. Kelly has this ex-girlfriend named Angie.  Now, Angie and I have been friends for a VERY long time.  Years...but after she and Kelly broke up, things got a little more complicated.  It was and still is very hard to find the balance to our friendship.  Now, to make things even that much more complicated...she lives with this horrible shit of a guy that I just don't get along with.  So, to make a very long story very short...she and I are trying to figure out how to see eachother and hang out while avoiding any of the drama that goes on in our house.  She lives upstairs, I live downstairs.  Now, the point at which I got driven up the wall was when I came in this morning and AGAIN I got a somewhat nasty email from Angie explaining that it is basically my duty to visit her in her apartment regardless of my feelings about her roommate.  I tried to be polite in my last reply to her, saying that I didn't feel comfortable in her place and that she really should just try to make an effort to come down to our apartment.  She didn't like this idea so much.  So, I had to write her AGAIN today and somehow try to squash the pure annoyance that is coursing through my veins.  I just don't think she understands...I just plain refuse to be in the same place as him.  He is not allowed in my apartment and I don't think that it is appropriate for me to be in his.  End of story.  If Kelly or Rita wanted this fuck to come down to our place for any reason, then they would be more than fair in making this request.  But I just can't do it and I won't be around if he is.  So my dilemma is...how do I get this point across to her without her being made to feel responsible.  I don't know.   That was the first thing.... After that, the day just seemed to tumble downward into a nasty spiral...work blows, I have no money this week, I have a lot of shit to do, and I miss Paul terribly.   The last few weeks were really pretty great.  Lots of days off.  Lots of time for sleep and movies and food.  I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  The highlight of it all had to be the trip to Boston and the visit with Paul over Easter.  He was so generous and sweet.  As he has been for a good long while.  The only problem with it is that I miss him more now than I have in the last couple of months.  I also know that I am not going to have a weekend to go to Boston until the end of April and that kind of gets me down.  Just got to push forward until that....maybe he can come soon? Overall, I have been in great spirits these days.  I feel very independent and strong.  I have been taking good care of myself, getting a little exercise, not masturbating too much, etc.  I have been doing some writing of my own and it feels good just to get it out on paper.  I am trying to work through a couple minor issues I got goin and doing some private journaling is helping me figure it all out.  Hey, it's what it is there for, right? GOD!  IF DORIS THE FUCK DON'T SHUT UP TODAY, I am going to KILL HER! What else? Kelly is almost done with her cigarette smoking habit.  Wednesday is her first day of fresh lungs and good smelling clothes.  Rita and I, being the lovely housemates we are, are assisting in converting our apartment to inhabit only non-smokers.  Well, at least the common living space.  Fuck if I don't get to smoke in my own room.  It will be kind of funny, actually.  I picture two things: 1)  Every time I open my bedroom door, a cloud of smoke will follow me out of my room, somewhat in the style of pigpen from Charlie Brown.  I will reek of smoke while everyone else smells pwetty.  My breath will be stank and my fingers will be yellow.  I suppose I have always had these attributes, but now that our house will be spring fresh, it will be just a little more obvious that I am a smoker. 2)  It will be funny that if we do decide to drink in the house or to eat dinner or watch a movie (pretty much every activity that involves remaining in the room other than my bedroom), I am going to have to get up every half hour or so to go to my dinge hole and smoke a butt.  LOL.  I mean really.  I am going to get more exercise smoking now then I ever have before.  I guess that's the ropes.  Plus, Rita doesn't smoke in her room.  So will she be going outside to smoke every cigarette?  She can come in my room and have a butt once in awhile.  But surely not every smoke.  That would make my room just filthy!   So this is going to be a trip.  I am real excited for Kelly.  I have nothing but love and support for her endeavor.  It is true that quitting smoking really starts to get hard once you have done it for awhile.  But I do have faith in her to keep it up.  And if she just so happens to pick up the habit again, I will be ready to start puffing in that living room like nothing ever changed.   If you haven't, see the movie 'Joyride'.  Rita and I watched it last week and it was excellent.  There are so many suspense movies out there and are just not worth it.  This one is.  Find the time. Also, if you are bored, please feel free to perform this little experiment:  This is a toll-free call to Cigna... Dial 1-800-564-8982 Press 2 Press 5228 I laughed.  You will laugh.  Your mom will laugh.  If not, she don't know what funny is. I just found a pimple forming on my forehead.  Great.  Perfect way for the day to continue. So, I have this admirer...if you check my guestbook, you will see the entry.  I think I know who it is, but I definitely could be wrong.  I have been emailing some of my readers and a couple of you have said that you didn't write it.  I still have one possible shot at figuring out who this sketch ball is....if it ain't you...I am going to be real excited.  Cuz maybe it's an agent asking to promote me.  But just in a very creative way.   Tomorrow is a new episode of 'The Real World'.  Like I have been saying, if you haven't tuned in yet, be sure to catch an all Real World marathon.  MTV plays it just about every weekend and you will love.  The people are great.  There is only one I hate on the whole show.  His name would be Chris the fag.  He is a piece of shit.  Don't listen to a word he says and if he tries to tell you that you are 'shameful' or 'wrong in the way you want to live your life'.  Tell him to fuck off and offer him a drink.  He thinks he's a recovering alcoholic.  But really, he's just gay. I split my lip the other day and every time I smile it re-splits.  Picture me with blood running down my chin at this very moment.  It looks kind of goth and hot.   Yesterday was a good day.  I got sufficient sleep, watched a movie in bed, relaxed for a bit and then crawled out of my room at like 4pm.  I haven't had one of those days in awhile.  Even on days off I am usually awake by noon the latest.  No matter what time I went to bed the night before.  After getting up, I cleaned the bathroom, cleaned my body, sang for a bit, and ate a wonderful meal prepared by one Miss Rita.  The biscuits were just about the best thing that has past through my mouth since the holidays.  I ate 5, I think.  Then after that, off to my room to do some more writing and tv watching.  It was so good.  I felt so rejuvenated this morning and then of course!  Shit hole job makes everything fall apart in a matter of minutes.  Fucking shit hole job. curse you. Tonight, I am planning on making a nice dinner, doing a little more writing, working on a monologue, and hopefully being in bed before it's too late.  I went to sleep much after 2:30am.  So maybe this evening I will try to get a sensible night's rest.   Okay, I have so much more to say, but it is going to have to wait a bit.  I have so much shit to catch up on.

By the time you teach her Juicy, she gone fuget Rappuhs DeLITE!   ---  Babs (Making the Band 2)  Guess whos back?  Back again.  Joeys back.  Tell a friend.  HI!!!  Totally my bad.  Who do I think I am anyway?  Someone with a real life?  Never.  Lets immediately get down to business, since I dont have an excuse big enough to make up for my lazy lack of posting.     Here are the things I need to discuss:  The present from Ahmad.  Yeah.  Well, Ahmad came to have lunch with me LAST WEDNESDAY (wow, been a long time) and brought my present with him.  After lunch, we went down to the auditorium in my building so I could open up my gift in private.  He wrote a beautiful card and the present was wrapped up all nice and shit.  Now remember, the present was supposed to exemplify how well Ahmad knows me.  I was nervous, excited, and totally curious.  When I opened up the gift, guess what it was?  No guess.  No really Hells, youd never be able to guess.   It was the  urlLink Pasta Pro .    Do you know of the Pasta Pro?  Its the pasta pot with a built in colander.  The second I saw it, I looked into his eager eyes and said Oh wow!  The Pasta Pro!  My parents got me that for my birthday too!  Ahmads face fell and he said Why didnt you tell me that?  I wanted my gift to you to be something that you really wanted.  I reply No I DID really want it.  And I love that you listen to me when I talk.  I just didnt think to tell you that my parents had already given it to me.  I feel terrible.  Im sorry.  We hugged and I thanked him over and over.  Then I said goodbye to him and offered to give one of my Pasta Pros to Ari.  I was a bit disappointed in the gift, but I really shouldnt have been.  How dare I?  Ahmad has known me for a month and he really went out of his way for me, what with making me dinner and baking me a cake and all that jazz.  But, I thought maybe he'd get me a new car or something.  Ah wellwill have to work on my gold-digging skillz.  NowPaul on the other hand.  I showed up at his apartment at 5:30pm last Wednesday.  I was told to get there as soon as I could.  When I walked in the door, Paul was standing in the bathroom door, butt-naked, shaving his face.  I looked at his cock and said Is that a drip of CUM on your cock?   Paul quickly looked down and goes Oops.  Yes.   What is WRONG with you?  Its my birthday and youve already made sure to masturbate so there is no chance of us hooking up tonight.  How could you start the night like this?   Im sorry Joe, I was horny.   Wipe up your dick and lets do whatever it is you have planned.   When Paul got out of the bathroom, he told me that we would watch  The Simpsons  until 8pm, cuz that is when we had our reservations for dinner. Wait.  Do you mean to tell me that we are going to smoke a bowl and go to dinner for my birthday? Yes Joe.  Is that not good enough? Honestly Paul, its not.  Thats what we do EVERY night.  I thought that maybe you would plan something fun for us to do. Dinner is fun and you are being selfish and greedy. WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA?  Its my birthday!  How could I even BE selfish and greedy? Just stop it.  Lets watch TV and get ready for dinner. 10 minutes later I started to cry.   WHY ARE YOU CRYING?!?!?! Because I decided to spend my birthday evening with just you and you havent planned shit for us.  In fact, I am SURE you waited until this afternoon to plan dinner.  I should be seeing my friends, who I know would take me out and plan something fun.  But it is so TYPICAL of you to forget about the entire thing and to quickly throw something together.  Im going home. Dont be so dramatic. (Tears flowing out of my face)  You are the WORST boyfriend on the planet.  I will never forget this day. FUCK YOU JOE!  We are going to a show at 8pm, but you had to go and ruin it! silence. huh? We are going to a show and if you could just wait an hour without freaking out silence. oh. Yeah. Well now I feel like such an asshole!  Why do you have to hurt my feelings in order to surprise me?  After that we started the night over.  We had some wine and got ready to go see  urlLink De La Guarda . The show was fucking mind-blowing.  I shouldn't explain to you what it was about, but if you EVER have the chance to go see it, you would be FOOLISH to miss it.  Definitely the best and most surprising thing I have seen in years.  After dinner, Paul took me to Brasserie on 52nd street.  It was by FAR the nicest and most expensive dinner I have ever had the pleasure of taking part in.  We had numerous appetizers, bottles of champagne, and I got the swordfish for dinner.  The price of dinner came to $255.  UM.  He even stopped and bought me dessert on the way home.  It was an absolutely wonderful evening and Paul secured his spot in my heart once again.  It wasnt about the money, but rather the fact that he actually planned something, wrote me a nice card, and made sure that I was happy all night long.  We laughed and laughed and laughed until we went to bed, happy as gay bugs in a gay bed.    The birthday party I had planned went off pretty smoothly, but to be honest, was my least favorite part of the weekend.  The highlight of our night out was that Kelly got a bodybuilder to pick me up and give me a hug.  Mmmmmmthat was the hottest.  Also, Mariah and Joanna gave me wonderful gifts and everyone treated me really well.  It just wasnt the night I had originally envisioned.   The 4th of July was amazing!  We drank beers and margaritas all day and smoked tons of the pot.  We hung out on Mariahs rooftop in Brooklyn and got ourselves a sweet tan.  We were also able to watch the fireworks up there.  The whole day and night was excellent.  There are more details, but why bore you with them?  You only care about dicks and vagina.  And thats that!  I feel very lucky to have the friends that I do.  They made the whole weekend special and fun.  At no point did I want to be anywhere else.  I loved my birthday, although anti-climactic at the party.    In other news, I got a letter from my other  urlLink prisoner pen-pal .  He wrote me the nicest letter and I have now decided that the only friends I want to have in my life are people with jail terms.  They have nice bodies, are confident and strong, and will take care of me always.  Theres just that little detail of them wanting to slice off my face, but whatever.  Ill risk it.  I already wrote Carlos back.  I hope we fall in love some day.    I havent talked to Ahmad since my birthday.  As each day goes by, I start feeling even guiltier than I felt the day before.  I am convinced that he hates me now.  I plan on calling him this afternoon to touch base, but I think he is going to spit on the receiver and put it near his ass so he can fart on me.  Why wouldnt he?  I took the present he had for me and never called again.  Its just that Paul and I are doing really well now and Id like to give our relationship another chance.  I told Paul that I would make a decision about Ahmad before the Bahamas trip.  He says that I should make my decision now.  Although I know that Ahmad and I need to call it off, I am not so sure I want to call off every possibility I have of meeting someone else.  Im doing my best to just play it by ear and to take it day by day, but that shit is boring and nothing ever gets solved that way.  Secretly I must love the drama.   Oh please, openly I must love the drama.  OkI think thats it!  I hope this entry will serve as my penance.  Work has been a nightmare lately, so I havent had the chance to catch up with all of you.  But I will make SURE to find time to do so in the next couple of days.  I can PROMISE you that.  And I can also promise you that I will not eat pizza.  Mariahs birthday card to me had a picture of she and I on the front and I had a HEART ATTACK when I realized how humungous I have gotten over the last couple of months.  It used to be funny before.  Not its just plain sick.   urlLink This  is the size of my belly.  AYUK AYUK.    Peace be with you my friends and lesbians.

107,107,470861,1,27,"                 I thought you would all be upset if a whole day went by without me telling you about the Nic dream I had last night.  No seriously.  If you think that I am just sitting here every day making up stories to tell...you are dead wrong.  DEAD WRONG! All of what I write is pure truth. If you get tired of hearing about my crazy nicotine dreams, leave me a comment.  Not that I will stop writing them or anything.  It will just give me a reason to laugh in your face. Let me begin... I am sitting in my house in Albany and we are having some sort of a party.  My whole family is there, including my gay uncles from California.  Kelly and Rita are also there, and guess what?  So is fucking BJ.  (Does BJ ALWAYS have to be in my nicotine dreams? In case you didn't know, the answer to that question is yes) There are also other people in the house, but they remain faceless, thus making them nameless.  We are all sitting there and talking when someone yells out that we should go to the local indoor playground.  (In Albany, we call it Stompin Grounds.  I worked there for 2 years.  They have big structures made of tubes, and bins full of colored balls to play in.  Although, do NOT play in them.  They are filled with kid piss.  Just an insiders piece of advice for ya.    We all load up into our various cars and drive to Stompin Grounds.  On the way, my uncles say that there is this new dinosaur game that we should all play. (I get very excited cuz I just LOVE dinosaurs.)  We pull up to Stompin Grounds and all file into the building.  Once inside, it is like kid heaven.  There are tons of those tube structures, numerous ball pens, and a food court, and a huge slide, and and and...so many things. I am thrilled!  I look around the place and there are about 100 students from the place that I work at.  They make some sort of announcement that the 'Dinosaur game' will start so I run over and get on my uniform.  The uniform for the dinosaur game is kind of like an athlete's jersey.  Mine was red.   I realize that no one else in the group wants to play the dinosaur game.  They only want to eat pizza and sit and watch.  I still play with people that I don't know and they all vary in age.   Some were 3 years old, some were 80 years old. The game begins and I don't know how to play.  All I know is that I have to figure out a way to destroy these so called dinosaurs.   A HUGE door opens from the bottom up and I see the most amazing thing.  There are two dinosaurs that must be at least 80 feet high.  They are gigantor and are both T-rex's.  One is green and one is red.  Oh.  Did I mention that they were made of Lego's?  Cuz they were.  Green and red legos.  Once the door is open, the T-rex's ROAR very loudly and start to step out of their holding pens.  All of the people I am with scream at the top of their lungs and start running to hide.  I am so excited to play and can't wait to get started.  I stand where I am and face the dinos.  The red T-rex steps right in front of me and bends down to pick up a little girl that is next to me.  I start laughing cuz she was caught.  The laughter stopped when I realize that this red lego T-rex swallows the little girl whole.  She just disappears into his massive belly.  I think to myself 'Um.  Is this the game I signed up for?  Dying isn't so much fun. '  I quickly run away and hide in climb inside one of the tube structures.  I hide in this yellow tube and watch the T-rex's scour the building for everyone in the game.  Everyone else that I came with sit on the sidelines, eating pizza and cheering for their favorite player.  I see my uncles and they mouth to me:  'YOU CAN DO IT!'  Little boys, old women, grown men, they all get swallowed whole by these dinosaurs.  I start to think to myself: 'How do I POSSIBLY destroy them to win the game?'  I see people throwing balls and other various objects at them and all it seems to do is piss them off more.   Even though I am totally hidden in one of the tubes, the red T-rex eyes me and comes charging towards the tube structure I am in.   I climb higher and higher until I at least 20 feet above him.  Now, I don't know how the T-rex does this, but he shrinks to a  smaller, but still huge size, and starts to climb into the tubes after me.   It was at this point that the dream turned into a horrifying nightmare.   I notice that the T-rex is very agile and is climbing up towards me very fast.  I find an exit slide in the tubes and I slide away from him.  Once at the bottom of this amazing slide, I see a lego Betty Rubble and Wilma Flintstone go running by me with one kid above each of their heads.  (Understand this...it may sound bizzare and slightly humorous, but when I saw them run by, a major streak of fear coursed through my veins.)(cuz I mean seriously...no one said that lego betty's and wilma's would be in the game!) I run over to my gay uncle Brad and I say: 'Help me!  HELP ME!'  He, along with the rest of my family, BURST out laughing at me and Brad says: 'You wanted to play, so go play.'  Yikes. I turn around and notice that the green T-rex and spotted me and is charging in my direction.  I look to my right and see a bathroom door.  I run over to it and go inside.  Once inside, I realize that it isn't a bathroom at all, but some sort of EXTREMELY small storage closet.  I lock the door and think to myself: 'He could never get in here.  It is air tight and there is a metal door separating the two of us. As I am thinking this, the T-rex starts to ram his head against the door.  The door seems to hold up and I feel relieved.  I'll just wait until the game is over and then I will come out, I think.   But the green T-rex isn't giving up.  He roars loudly and then takes a huge bite out of the top of the door.  I scream as well and back as far as I can into the corner.  The T-rex starts taking bite after bite out of the door, with a HUGE vengence.  The strength he has proves to be too much for the storage closet.  A whole opens up to my right.  After the T-rex finishes off the door, I stand there screaming.  He then lunges at me with the biggest lego teeth I have ever seen.  I quickly jump over his snout and through the hole that has opened up.  I go running as fast as I can back to the huge tube structure that I was in.   The T-rex screams 'I AM GOING TO GET YOU!' (Yes, you got that right.  Suddenly the T-rex speaks very good English) I climb and climb into the tubes and once I am at the very highest point of the structure I look down and see his huge head below me.  At this point he is eating someone, but I can't tell who it is.  I look across the room and see this kid Orahn that is a student at my workplace.  (Yes Ari.  Orahn is waving at me from across the room....why the FUCK is he in my dream?)  I wave back, as though I have the time, and look back down at the T-rex.  His doesn't seem to be noticing me, but I notice that on the very top of his skull is a button that says  'PUSH ME'.  Without even thinking about it, I vault over the side of the structure and I land directly on the button.  The entire dinosaur collapses VERY GENTLY under me and the T-rex turns into a baby lego T-rex.   Swear to God, the fear leaves me and I think 'How cute!'   I pick up the baby T-rex and hold it in the palm of my hand.  I look around the room and no one is running anywhere.  It's just kids playing normal games like 'Who can climb the tubes fastest?' or 'Try to find me in the balls!' The game seems to be over.  Uncle Brad calls out: 'Time to go home.'  I go over to meet my family and we leave Stompin' Grounds.  As we walk out to the parking lot, I wake up. WHA WHA WHAT?!?!?!?! And that's it.  But when I woke up, I was still petrified.  Why the FUCK did I dream about this.  Why the FUCK have I had any of the dreams that I have had in the last 3 nights?  I can blame it on the nicotine patch, or I can just accept the fact that I think in ways that only psycho-paths and serial killers think.   Hmmm....

117,117,470861,1,27,"                 So it has happened huh?    The war has begun.    I dont know about you, but I knew it was going to happen all along.  I think anyone with a military family knew that this was going to happen all along.  Many of my friends had kept hope that this would just blow over, but as the months went by, it was pretty much inevitable that there was no other solution to this situation.    Last night, as I sat and watched the coverage on NBC, I was shocked at the realism of this entire thing.  Being able to see Baghdad and the activity that was going on around the city was terrifying.  While I wanted nothing more than to switch the channel, I joined America in watching history being made.  About 30 minutes into the live coverage, I lost my mind.  Paul and I had been arguing over something incredibly stupid and as the tension between us escalated, I felt any sort of control I had over my emotions escape me.  I started shaking uncontrollably and the tears just poured out of my face.  Why? I kept screaming.  Why?!  It was so overwhelming.  Paul immediately stopped yelling at me and moved over to sit next to me on the couch.  He put his arm around me and I cried and cried and cried.  He dialed my home phone number and I talked to my father.  When my life spirals out of control, my parents are the people I want to talk to the most.  My dad, having been in the military for over 27 years knows so much more about the world and war than I could ever imagine.  Having retired as a Lieutenant Colonel just over 4 years ago, he is currently struggling with the fact that his old unit has been activated and deployed to the borders of Iraq.  He is on the phone daily with numerous family members of those that used to serve under him.  Regardless of the fact that he is no longer an active member of the United States Army, he is still the touchstone for a lot of people who have had their fathers, brothers, sisters, and mothers be sent off to war.   He is an amazing man.  So I called him and within 3 minutes and 37 seconds (according to the cell phone), my dad had wiped my tears, told me that the anxiety and upset that I was feeling was natural, and also that I have to focus on the fact that we are a strong army that will come out victorious.  He and I fought the idea of this war together over the last 12 months; writing letters, signing petitions, etc.  But now that we are at the point when peace is no longer an option, it is our duty as Americans to stand by our country and to support all those that are fighting on our behalf.  My dad has a way of finding the right words to say within this delicate situation so that I dont walk away hating either the US for their military action or Iraq for being such a belligerent, nasty country.  I have told my dad before that he is my hero, and today, I feel it more strongly than ever.    Same with my brother.  I had a great talk with him today that was filled with laughter and joy.  He is very optimistic about his position and while we are all afraid of the danger he is going to be put into, as long as he can hold himself together, I surely can too.  I want every talk with him to be nothing short of positive.  I ask him about his new girlfriend, his daily routine, and his friends.  He asks me about my job, Paul, my friends, and my new apartment in Times Square.  He is doing big and great things with his life right now and I have never been so proud of him.  Nor so scared at the thought of losing him.    He got his Small Pox vaccine this morning.  Turns out, the vaccine takes 3 weeks to take hold of your system.  Until that time comes, he will have numerous side effects, most of which are pretty harmless.  There is a chance of death after receiving this vaccine, though he and I are not worried about that possibility.  He is more likely to have his Bradley (tank) blown up than he is to develop a deadly case of Small Pox.  He says that no one can touch the spot where he got the shot until the scab falls off.  If anyone comes in contact with this area, they will immediately develop this disease and if not treated immediately, this person would die.  He also informed me that he is going to visit his girlfriend this weekend.  When I asked him if he was going to have sex with her, he said Fuck yeah.  I replied with But Winfield, what if she rubs against your arm?   Winfield:  Then I call 911. Me:  Well thats pretty fucking dangerous, dont you think? W:  Nah.  Im going to wear long sleeves. Me:  I think shes going to get small pox from you. W:  Joe, I will be careful, I promise. Me:  Well, what if your scab falls off while you are visiting her? W:  Then I wont be contagious anymore. Me:  Yeah, but what if she finds the scab in the bed and starts eating it? W:  What? Me:  What if you wake up and Nina is lying next to you, pensively chewing on the small pox scab that has fallen off your arm? W:  Then I would do two things.  1) I would dump her and 2) I would call 911. Me:  Oh.  Ok.  See, so Winfield and I are covering the basics while still trying to make eachother laugh.  He is such a great kid.  And he is making my family and myself so incredibly happy with how well he is doing with this whole ARMY thing.  He is up for another promotion and is getting rave reviews from both his commanders and platoon.  Plus, he has promised me that after he goes to war, he will be able to come home for a months worth of block leave.  And then after that, he will have two years left until he is out of the ARMY.  And at this point, he says that he wants nothing more than to do that and to settle into something more his style.    Thank God.  I will have my brother back.  But for nowfor now I focus on him and on every person that has left their loved ones behind in order to fight for what we, as a country, believe is right.  This is a scary time and as Paul said so eloquently last night No one should be alone right now.  He then hung his grandfathers American Flag outside of his window in support of our troops.  I fell in love with him all over again.    Switching gears  Guess what?  I dont know if its because I sobbed my eyes out or what, but Paul and I kissed and kissed and kissed last night.  We ran our hands and bodies all over eachother.  Its been two months since we have been intimate and last night was an amazing first step.  We didnt hook up to the point of orgasm, but it felt so good to have his hands running over my body again.  I felt safe and I felt happy.  He is still taking small steps when it comes to our physical relationship, but I am willing to work with him on this every step of the way.  Just before we fell asleep, I said: I want to have sex with you.  Pauls arm tightened around my shoulders and he kissed me on the neck.  It was a beautiful moment. Very beautiful.  And then he fucked me.  Hardcore style.  So anywaytonight we are all going to The Hole.  Nice name for a bar, huh?  Nice and SKANKY.  I have written about this place in my journal before.  $10 for all the booze and sluts you can handle.  Its pretty slimy, but with the right people, a fucking blast.  Kelly is spending the night at Pauls place because she was pretty scared and upset being alone in Times Square last night.  I dont blame her at all.  If something happens to NYC, Times Square is not the place I want to be in.  Nor do I want to be in Harlem.  But thats just cuz.  Alright, off to lunch.    I just want us all to remember one thing.    No matter what your views on this war happen to be, we are all in it together.  This is OUR country and whether we agree with everything the president does or not, we have chosen to make this a democracy ruled by the people.  And the people have chosen to go to war.  Feel how you want, but support those that risk their lives daily for your freedom.

124,124,554681,0,45,"       Elizabeth Sims was asked to write about the bookstore wars from the point of view of the chains by the American editor of LOGOS: The Journal of the World Book Community, a quarterly published in the UK by Colin Whurr. This is the piece she wrote. It was published as the lead article in LOGOS volume 13, issue 2, released in July, 2002. It was accompanied by a response written by Andy Ross, owner of Codys Books in Berkeley, California.     Note:  This is long.    Store Wars: the Case for the Chains   by Elizabeth Sims  Elizabeth Sims. All rights reserved.  During the winter of 1993-94, I managed a Borders Books & Music store in suburban Chicago. One day one of my assistants caught up with me on the sales floor. Youre going to love this one, she said. A customer just told me that somebody somewhere went to a chain store and asked if they carried The Shipping News. Guess what the clerk said? Lets check in periodicals, right? The book had come out two weeks ago. Right. Oh, boy, I thought, were going to be hearing that one for a long time. And, in fact, if Id had a jelly doughnutand eaten itfor every time I heard that story since, Id be sought after by every freak show in the nation. It doesnt matter whether the story is true; Ive little doubt that it is, in spite of the fact that the particularswhich chain? which clerk?instantly dissolved into apocrypha. What matters is that the story summarizes what many independent booksellers and their supporters believe: The superstore companies are loaded with philistines. Arent you glad were pure? The story has been a touchstone for many, and, though by now quite stale, still is.  *****  Twenty years ago, the book business was virtually non-competitive. If you wanted to open a bookstore in America, you rented a space you liked, you bought some inventory, and you hung up your sign. Your shop was small, you drew customers from your neighborhood, and you made a modest living selling merchandise you liked very much. You rarely advertised, except in the phone book. You never thought about competing with the store on the other side of the neighborhood or across town, never thought about being an aggressive marketer, because aggressive marketing wasnt nice. You got into bookselling because you liked to read and talk about books, not because you wanted to exhaust yourself writing press releases and analyzing cash flow and pushing hot sellers and beating the other guy. For customers in those days, shopping for books was a pretty sedate, and limiting, experience. Tom and Louis Borders opened a small used book shop in 1971 in Ann Arbor, Michigan. After a while they began to sell new books, moving to larger quarters. Seeing their sales rise every time they increased their inventory, they wondered just how big an inventory they could build, while keeping precise track of it, and making their buying more responsive to customer desires. Louis, the mathematical one, came up with a computer program that helped them do this. It was clunky at first, but over time it became a powerful engine of efficiency. Barnes & Noble emulated the Borders inventory system, ringing their own changes on it as they went along. These systems today are incredibly sophisticated, increasing by powers of ten the effectiveness of their human masters, the buyers. It has never been recognized sufficiently that the highly customized inventory control system is what revolutionized bookselling, not pretty carpets and hanging plants. It is the most critical key to the success of the superstore chains. In the 1980s the typical bookstore carried 5,000-10,000 titles, about all the inventory a sole proprietor could keep in memory or a card file. Borders and Barnes & Noble, using their potent inventory systems, began opening stores with 75,000-100,000 titles. Customers went wild for the huge inventories, to say nothing of other services like special orders at no extra charge, free gift wrapping and washrooms. As the superstores gradually expanded their operations, most independent booksellers simply watched. They watched, but did nothing. And most allowed themselves to be caught absolutely flat-footed by this new competition. Well, yes, I know that some small book shops in other parts of the country have closed, after the superstores came to town, but that wont happen to me. My customers are loyal. They somehow ignored that paramount axiom of retail: there is no such thing as a loyal customer. Customers will patronize you as long as you meet their needs, whatever those needs are. If someone else comes along and does what you do, only better, your customers become their customers. I dont know why so many independent booksellers take tremendous pride in being naive about the nuts and bolts of business. One independent bookseller protested to me, after a panel discussion, Im a book lover, not a businesswoman! A few years ago a publishers representative commented to me over dinner, The problem nobody talks about is that most independent booksellers are crappy, crappy business-people. I had the unusual experience of working for a respected independent as it morphed into a large chain. Having been an avid customer of Tom and Louis Borderss first store in Ann Arbor, I went to work for them 1987, starting as a floor clerk in the second Borders they opened, in Birmingham, Michigan. I built a career there, eventually becoming regional director for the West Coast. I left the company in 1997 to follow my dream of being a writer. Now my living is still tied directly to bookstores, and I like it that way. As a Borders spokeswoman I gave interviews and participated in panel discussions and radio debates. Ive been insulted and despised by some independent booksellers, and regarded as a curiosity by others. When Borders was a small outfit, we conducted a simple survey asking customers to rate characteristics of book stores according to importance: price, selection, service, location, special events, ambiance, etc. Quite consistently, customers rated selection highest in importance. Thus when I read an item in Publishers Weekly about an independent book shop owner in southern California who announced he was going to meet the competition of a new Borders by remodeling his store, I knew he had set the clock ticking on himself. He thought his inventory and services were fine the way they were, and he assumed the only difference between himself and Borders was customer comfort. After borrowing heavily to remodel, then seeing little or no increase in sales, he shut down, vociferously blaming Borders. Is that really who was to blame? I have a magazine article from 1995 in which an independent book shop owner was asked whether her sales were up or down since a Borders opened very nearby. She noted that sales were neither up nor down in her small store, but grumbled that she and her staff were working three times harder, though. Working three times harder? What had they been doing before Borders showed up? Well, this: when I visited that store while the Borders was under construction, two of three staff members were seated, not doing much as far as I could tell. That was too much help to have on hand on a weekday afternoon in a store that size. I identified myself and spoke with the owner, a very nice woman who appeared to know her inventory well. She told me she was concerned about the new competition, but evidently had no plans to meet it. I wanted her to know that our staff would make a point of referring customers to her store in the event Borders didnt have what they wanted. Some months later, I was told that customers coming into her store carrying Borders bags were asked to leave. In addition, I was told by the Borders managers that they had approached her to try to do some special events cooperatively, and were turned down. That store is closed now, and Borders was blamed by one and all. So it was no surprise to me to be asked, during an interview for a television program, whether I felt guilty about being a Borders executive, guilty about what Borders had done to the independents. Perhaps not hiding my anger very well, I answered no, that I was proud of the fine stores wed built, proud of the millions of customers wed pleased over the years. It is the independents who should feel guilty. Guilty of taking their customers thoroughly for granted. Guilty of not seeking to improve their stores until, for many, it was too late. Guilty of refusing to expand their services. Guilty of refusing to spend money to compete and to accept the temporarily lower profit margin such measures would bring. Guilty of refusing to carry books they didnt like, whether such books were romance novels, computer how-tos, finance guides, or what have you. Ask your favorite independent booksellers what percentage of their sales come from discounted titles on the bestseller lists. Ask them what their returns rate is. Ask them what their overall turn rate is, and turn rate by subject. Nine out of ten wont know. Its not hard to acquire these statistics, it just takes some effort and attention to detail. Numbers like those can help an owner make more intelligent decisions about inventory, can help a store exploit strength and bolster weakness. Ask if theyve ever read a book on economics. Ask when was the last time they cast a savage eye on overhead, from the cost of cleaning supplies to printer cartridges to cat food, to their lease itself, and challenged themselves to find cheaper ways to get good business done. The best independents withstood the challenge of the chains by focusing on their inventory, their costs, and their space, just as the chains did. Some expanded their space to accommodate more inventory. Others chose to limit and customize their inventories to achieve greater depth than ever before, using newly available software that interfaced with digital cash registers. Others moved their stores to more favorable locations. Many began discounting books. Some focused, as well, on hosting more frequent author readings and other special events. All found ways to better control their expenses. And their customers are much the happier for it.  *****  For the independents the worst is certainly over: the growth spurt of the chains is now slowing in America. Superstores have coexisted with independents for going on two decades. But where America was ten years ago, more or less, Europe is now. Superstores are springing up in the U.K. and elsewhere, and the debate has begun. Mind you, as far as customers are concerned there is no debate. More books, more choices, more servicesthat settles it, no matter who runs the store. The debate is not about whether superstores are inherently better or worse than independents. On the contrary, Ive come to understand over the years that the debate is about nothing so much as ideology. It is difficult to find common ground in this argument about business, because most independent booksellers do not consider themselves capitalists. They do not consider themselves capitalists because they think capitalism is about power and greed. They think it is about the abuse of the weak by the strong. It is about none of those things. Capitalism is about individual choice. Customer choice, merchant choice. Millions of individual choices are made every hour in the marketplace: choice is what makes it all work. Some independent booksellers are uncomfortable with this. No wonder: millions of customers with the freedom to choose is a frightening thing, if you doubt your ability to convince them to buy from you. So this ideological debate, such as it is, turns on independent owners making accusations against the chains, and the chains ignoring those accusations. A wide palette of charges have been employed, endlessly voiced, massaged, tweaked, and voiced again. When a perceived adversary disregards your complaints and insinuations, you feel more certain and increasingly righteous. You begin to believe that you really are a victim. The role of victim has always offered a considerable level of comfort and sense of self-righteousness. So much for a general approach to this matter. Lets look at the specific charges leveled against the chains. The following is by no means an exhaustive list of the particular denunciations, but it includes all of the most common.  1.  The chains only succeeded by copying the independents. If Borders and Barnes and Noble wished to copy independents, they would have opened vastly different stores than they did. They would have established a handful of stores with large inventories, a larger number with middle-sized inventories, but mostly small shops. Some of them would do special orders; others wouldnt; yet others would do special orders if they were for a publisher they already had an account with; and lastly some that would do any special order anytime, as long as the guy who handled it wasnt on vacation or off sick. Some that would take personal checks, ones that wouldnt. Shops that wouldnt carry books on hunting or guns, but would carry every word that Wittgenstein ever wrote. Staffs would range from the super-friendly to the surly and/or condescending.  2.  The chains situate their stores to do maximum damage to the local independents. To believe this you must believe that independents are the center of the bookselling universe. You must believe that the indies were the obsession of the chains, subjects of intense scrutiny and fascination, and fit for imitation. By analogy, you must believe that Henry Ford created the assembly line in order to ruin the lives of harness makers. Never will independent booksellers believe the truth, which is that the big chains carefully appraise the sites selected by each other, while the location of independents is almost always irrelevant. Borders contracted demographic surveys for each town in which they considered placing a store; Barnes & Noble undoubtedly did the same. There is no value in assuming that existing independents have placed their stores optimally. Chains seek to place their stores where the best concentration of potential customers is. Having located such a district, the trick is finding appropriate retail space. Furthermore, when deciding to build a store that will have to do $5m to $12m of business per year to justify its investment, what sense could it possibly make to deliberately plop it next to an independent doing no more than $250,000 per year, using that as the only criterion? But if an ideal space opens up in the desired area, and it happens to be near an independent, it is not the chains job to keep that shop in business.  3.  The chains spied on independents. A distinct, and beloved, variation on the center-of-the-universe theory. So many independents believe theyve been the subject of espionage that if all the corporate spies required to do such Herculean work were placed end to end, theyd reach coast to coast at least once. One successful independent in northern California published a piece in its newsletter suggesting that it was spied on before the Borders store opened a few towns over. The piece described a cadre of men in suits looking around the store, making comments and studying things carefully, and suggested that the men were Borders operatives, clumsily revealing themselves to be the nasty corporate spies they were. As the ranking Borders executive on the West Coast at the time, I can tell you that not only did we not have any men in suits on the payroll, but the idea of spying on another store was out of the question. We took great pride in our stores, considered Borders to be the best in the business, and so expected others to be spying on us.  4.  With the big chains, buying power gets concentrated into a few hands, and thats dangerous for a free press. This is the one argument that, on the surface, appears to have some teeth. Of course, nobody wants the caprice of some cubicle-bound drone to dictate whether a writer will have a career, or be found beneath the dark waters of a lonely canal, a suicide whose frustrated death should be blamed on Borders. The reality is that as long as there is a multitude of authors, publishers, readers, and sellers in the market, bookstore buying cannot lapse into sloppiness or be driven by corporate whim or ideology. If a chain were to lapse in some way, a significant hole would develop in its ability to serve a heterogeneous market, one into which its competitors will be more than happy to jump and scoop up that market share for themselves, be they other chains or a slew of sharp independents.  5.  The chains use/used crooked business practices. Since the dawn of the chain bookstore era, the chains have been accused of thievery. This makes perfect sense if you share the Steinbeckian belief with many independent booksellers that any large corporation is, by definition, immoral. (See capitalism, above.) In 1998 the American Booksellers Association (ABA) filed a lawsuit against Borders and Barnes & Noble, charging that the two companies had exacted special, and hence illegal, deals on prices of books and on cooperative reimbursement. This was supposed to be the capstone of a series of book business lawsuits, the one that would finally give the chains their comeuppance and show the world what kind of stuff the ABA was made of. The ABA membership was eager to believe that the chains used tremendous leverage to strong-arm publishers into doing business their way. Curiously, at the same time, the ABA appeared to believe that publishers couldnt wait to jump into bed with the chains, that everything was wink-wink and lets fleece the little guys. The basic question that was never asked is: What leverage? When you run a chain of hardware stores, you buy nails by the boxcar-load from manufacturers. The fact that more than one company produces nails is something you can use to bargain with. We need three boxcar-loads of galvanized roofing nails. The ABC company is giving us twelve for a penny; can you beat it? If you can, you get our business. This is leverage. But booksellers have no such bargaining power, no matter how big they are. If you want a book by a particular author you can only buy it from one publisher. Which prompts the next question: Why would publishers be willing to give up profits? The obvious answer is, they werent. If you want the latest Tom Clancy or P.D. James or Don DeLillo for cheap, go see if you can buy it from some other publisher. It was only after years of negotiating, years of building relationships with publishers, years of inventing ways to make it more economical for publishers to do business with them, that the chains began to receive better terms. It is not illegal to negotiate for better terms, nor is it illegal to get them. And, on the publishers end, it is not illegal to sell the same merchandise to different customers on different terms. There are any number of tangibles that can justify charging different prices to different customers, largely based on publishers internal costs.  A few specifics on the lawsuit, which went to trial in 2001:  a) The ABA produced an expert witness who testified that the savings extended to the chains by publishers were not cost-justified. But the case was settled before the witness could be either cross-examined by defense counsel, or challenged by defense witnesses. b) The ABA, whose members comprise 18 percent of the retail, or trade book market, pointed to many injuries allegedly suffered by them due to the competitive free market, but not one injury done to consumers. c) The ABA spent three years and at least $18 million to press this suit, from which they received a cash settlement of $4.7m, reached after presenting about a third of their case, over six days of trial. The chains, which paid $2.35 million apiece, made no agreement to change their business practices. Aside from cross-examination of all but one of the plaintiffs witnesses, there is no record of the defense case, because there was no need to present it. $2.35 million is not paltry, but in plain fact it amounted to a nuisance settlement for each chain, paid simply to save further legal costs in defending against the suit. A Borders executive told me the suit had had no impact whatsoever on the way Borders does business. d) Avin Domnitz, CEO of the ABA, told me, however, that the suit was tremendously successful at leveling the playing field. He meant that the ABA takes credit for the fact that a number of publishers, in the years after the suit was filed and before the trial, made terms and coop programs more appealing to independent booksellers. Really? The ABAs litigation was that influential? Mightnt one reasonably suppose that the cause was the years of negotiation by the chains, now filtering down to the independents? e) Some ABA dues-payers wondered whether their organization spent their $18 million wisely. So do I. How might the ABA have used that money in a more businesslike way? They might have issued low-interest loans to member stores that wished to expand. They might have organized collective buying and distribution arrangements for their members. They might have developed strategies to negotiate with publishers for coop funds for the collective benefit of the members. Tough work, to be sure.  6.  Many chain stores arent profitable, but are kept open in order to crush the independents. This one lives on and on. I was in an independent book shop last fall to speak to the owner about my forthcoming novel. During our talk I mentioned that I once worked for Borders. She launched into a tutorial on the sins of my former employer. The chains, she told me, have cash flow, but theyre not profitable. They keep stores openmany storesin order to drive the independents out of business. I said, Well, Borders stores are profitable. I saw the balance sheets for every store every month until I left the company. I tried to explain that the chains do not have mountains of cash to hide ongoing failure. Theyre expected by shareholders to turn a profit. It is true that Borders and Barnes & Noble regularly post losses. But that is because they are still expanding. If a chain has 200 stores and wants to build 40 more this year, it must show the bank that the 200 are making money, in order to qualify for the loans needed to build the 40 more. Businesses do not get additional funds if they cant show they are making their business work. The overall financial picture becomes a loss because the expenses of opening 40 new stores outstrip the profits made by the 200 existing. That is why the chains stock is regarded by shareholders as a growth stock. If they someday stop growing, their shareholders will expect a continuing stream of dividends, as opposed to an increasing stock price. I could tell this shop owner didnt believe me, but she politely changed the subject to the rafts of crooked deals shed heard the chains make with publishers. When I attempted to refute this assertion too, she reassured me comfortably, Well, it didnt happen at your level. The ABA could, if it wished, have put an end to this rumor-mongering, since it had subpoenaed detailed profit-and-loss statements of both chains during the discovery phase of its case against them.  7.  The chains steal/stole customers from the independents by offering discounts, and independents cant really afford to discount. The Borders brothers began giving 10 percent off most hardcovers when they were a single store. In 1985, the year they opened their second store, they began giving 30 percent off New York Times hardcovers as well. They were able to do this and remain profitable because their business practices were sound. The charge that the chains sold books cheaply to entice hordes of customers away from indies is yet another self-deception fabricated by the independents. The percentage of total sales represented by discounted books sold by the chains runs to about three percent bestsellers, and 10-11 percent discounted hardcovers. Thirteen to 14 percent of total book sales is hardly enough to have seduced book buyers into buying 86-87 percent of their purchases at full list price from the chains.  8.  Remember, some chains stopped selling The Satanic Verses when the fatwa on Salman Rushdie was announced. They cant be counted on to carry controversial books. This is an oft-repeated, half-baked factoid. Here is what happened. After the Ayatollah announced his fatwa against Salman Rushdie, some book chains were sent bomb threats for carrying the novel. Borders did not pull the book, though I know that the store I was working in at the time received at least one threat by telephone. Waldenbooks, at the time owned by Kmart, sent word to its managers in large urban areas that they could use their own discretion as to whether or not to pull the book from display, but not from inventory.  The stores that chose to pull it from display returned it to the shelves after no more than two weeks. How good are independents at carrying controversial titles? The biggest and arguably most controversial American book of 1995 was Newt Gingrichs To Renew America. While it was on the bestseller lists, I was surprised to walk into a large Los Angeles independent and be greeted with a prominent sign announcing, NO NEWTS! Just to make sure, I asked whether the sign meant what it appeared to mean, and was told that yes, the store had decided not to carry the book. It shouldnt be surprising that independent book store owners tend to lean to the left politically. Ive seen many more instances of independents using their stores as platforms for their political or ideological views, from the posting of slogans and advertisements and opinions, to the choices of front-of-store titles. The Turner Diaries is by any standard a controversial book. A bizarre reactionary tract vaguely akin to Mein Kampf and portions of Ayn Rand and Swift, it was used as a notional guide by Timothy McVeigh in his preparation for the bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma. It is reasonable to suppose that it is read and taken literally by other wackos. It is also purchased and read by people who are interested in it for other reasons. I called stores around northern California, where I live, looking for the book, and found that of the three large general independents I called, none carried it as a regular item, though all would order it on request. But the three Borders stores closest to those independents do carry it as a standard in-stock item. Why? Because it sells, to the tune of a thousand copies per year in Borders stores. Independent booksellers are not champions of controversial titles. They are champions of the correct controversial titles.  *****  The ABA leadership has spent enormous amounts of energy and money fostering in its membershipand anybody else who would listenthe belief that independent booksellers are victims. And the association has cast itself as the avenger, seeking to take away the benefits their competitors worked long and hard for instead of forging its own way. Is this situation likely to change? After all, the victim role is extremely popular with independent booksellers. Not with all, but with dismayingly many. It makes them feel superior. It buys them sympathy. But the bind into which these independents have firmly strapped themselves, with the help of the ABA leadership, is this: how do they maintain the comfort of feeling blameless for their own troubles, yet gain the gumption for unflinching self-examination, which is the bedrock of being a strong competitor? If the indies admit that the playing field has been level all along, then if they havent prospered, its their own fault. Such a conclusion is unbearable for those who have invested heavily in self-pity. The chains, however, in their efforts to drive their stock prices ever higher, are compromising some of the essential practices that made their businesses great. They have become mammoth corporations, far larger than any of us envisioned in the early days. In organizations of such size, size itself takes on a life of its own, and it will sap the soul of the business if not attended to. High standards of in-store presentation, which are expensive to maintain, are relaxed, even forgotten. Labor gets squeezed. Home-office departments turn into fiefdoms fighting for prominence. Leadership becomes averse to risk. It doesnt have to be this way, but when leadership chooses to be driven by quarterly earnings instead of by customers, it does happen. And irresolute leadership will destroy a companyslowly, painfully, and thoroughly. Yes, when the chains were new and dynamic, many of their weaker competitors fell by the wayside. But the wayside is also where surprises can hide, ready to ambush a competitor who has grown more ponderous than agile. Both chains and independents have things to learn. Its a great time to be selling books.          ",5833,1000,Elizabeth Sims was asked to write about the bookstore wars from the point of view of the chains by the American editor of LOGOS The Journal of the World Book Community a quarterly

of Codys Books in Berkeley California Note This is long Store Wars the Case for the Chains by Elizabeth Sims Elizabeth Sims All rights reserved During the winter of I managed a Borders Books Music

little doubt that it is in spite of the fact that the particularswhich chain which clerk?instantly dissolved into apocrypha What matters is that the story summarizes what many independent booksellers and their supporters believe The superstore companies are loaded with philistines Arent you glad were pure The story has been a touchstone for many and though by now quite stale still is Twenty years ago the book business was virtually non-competitive If you wanted to open a bookstore in America you rented a space you liked you bought some inventory and you hung up your sign Your shop was small you drew customers from your neighborhood and you made a modest living selling merchandise you liked very much You rarely advertised except in the phone book You never thought about competing with the store on the other side of the neighborhood or across town never thought about being an aggressive marketer because aggressive marketing wasnt nice You got into bookselling because you liked to read and talk about books not because you wanted to exhaust yourself writing press releases and analyzing cash flow and pushing hot sellers and beating the other guy For customers in those days shopping for books was a pretty sedate and limiting experience Tom and Louis Borders opened a small used book shop in in Ann Arbor Michigan After a while they began to sell new books moving to larger quarters Seeing their sales rise every time they increased their inventory they wondered just how big an inventory they could build while keeping precise track of it and making their buying more responsive to customer desires Louis the mathematical one came up with a computer program that helped them do this It was clunky at first but over time it became a powerful engine of efficiency Barnes Noble emulated the Borders inventory system ringing their own changes on it as they went along These systems today are incredibly sophisticated increasing by powers of ten the effectiveness of their human masters the buyers It has never been recognized sufficiently that the highly customized inventory control system is what revolutionized bookselling not pretty carpets and hanging plants It is the most critical key to the success of the superstore chains In the s the typical bookstore carried titles about all the inventory a sole proprietor could keep in memory or a card file Borders and Barnes Noble using their potent inventory systems began opening stores with titles Customers went wild for the huge inventories to say nothing of other services like special orders at no extra charge free gift wrapping and washrooms As the superstores gradually expanded their operations most independent booksellers simply watched They watched but did nothing And most allowed themselves to be caught absolutely flat-footed by this new competition Well yes I know that some small book shops in other parts of the country have closed after the superstores came to town but that wont happen to me My customers are loyal They somehow ignored that paramount axiom of retail there is no such thing as a loyal customer Customers will patronize you as long as you meet their needs whatever those needs are If someone else comes along and does what you do only better your customers become their customers I dont know why so many independent booksellers take tremendous pride in being naive about the nuts and bolts of business One independent bookseller protested to me after a panel discussion Im a book lover not a businesswoman A few years ago a publishers representative commented to me over dinner The problem nobody talks about is that most independent booksellers are crappy crappy business-people I had the unusual experience of working for a respected independent as it morphed into a large chain Having been an avid customer of Tom and Louis Borderss first store in Ann Arbor I went to work for them starting as a floor clerk in the second Borders they opened in Birmingham Michigan I built a career there eventually becoming regional director for the West Coast I left the company in to follow my dream of being a writer Now my living is still tied directly to bookstores and I like it that way As a Borders spokeswoman I gave interviews and participated in panel discussions and radio debates Ive been insulted and despised by some independent booksellers and regarded as a curiosity by

132,132,554681,0,45,"        Fall books preview  The hot new titles to look for in the coming months, from fiction to biography to politics.  - - - - - - - - - - - - By Laura Miller  Sept. 11, 2003  |  Over the next three months, the publishing industry floods bookstores with the best -- and sometimes just the flashiest -- books of the year. It can be hard to keep up even when it's your job, so for the average overwhelmed reader out there, we offer this highly selective list of titles to watch out for.   Politics   With the 2004 campaign season heating up, expect the usual rash of snoozy trail tracts by the likes of John Kerry ('A Call to Service,' from Viking in October) and John Edwards ('My Trials,' from Simon & Schuster in January), plus 'Winning Modern Wars: Iraq, Terrorism and the American Empire' by Wesley Clark, coming from Princeton next month. Walter Shapiro kills, er, covers several birds with one stone in 'One-Car Caravan: On the Road With the 2004 Democratic Hopefuls' (Public Affairs, November). Bush haters will lap up 'Bushwhacked' by Molly Ivins and Lou Dubose (Random House), also set to arrive in September, Michael Moore's 'Dude, Where's My Country?' (Warner, October) and 'The Lies of George W. Bush' by David Corn (Crown, September). TV commentator Alan Colmes offers the undoubtedly more tepid 'Red, White and Liberal: Why the Left is Right and the Right is Wrong' (ReganBooks, October).   On the other side, Bill O'Reilly (yes, again) asks 'Who's Looking Out For You?' (Broadway Books, September) and Bernard Goldberg deplores 'Arrogance: Rescuing America From the Media Elite' (Warner, November). What Greta Van Susteren will have to say in 'My Turn at the Bully Pulpit' (Crown, September) is anyone's guess. Meanwhile, Pulitzer-winning playwright Tony Kushner will seek to rally the nation's youth with 'Save Your Democratic Citizen Soul!' (New Press, November). And for those craving dish from deep inside the Beltway, there's 'The Georgetown Ladies Social Club' by C. David Heymann (Atria, October) about the klatch of five women who ran D.C. over the past half-century.   History   It's shaping up to be a terrific season for narrative histories in the spirit of Laura Hillenbrand's 'Seabiscuit.' We're particularly looking forward to: 'The Bounty,' an account of the notorious mutiny by 'Endurance' author Caroline Alexander (Viking, September); 'Fallingwater Rising,' a 'biography' of Frank Lloyd Wright's famous house by Franklin Toker (Knopf, September); 'A Venetian Affair,' based on some long-lost 18th century love letters written by the ancestor of author Andrea di Robilant (Knopf, September); David Foster Wallace's history of the concept of infinity, 'Everything and More' (W.W. Norton, October); 'The Perfect Prince,' the true story of a Renaissance-era imposter by Ann Wroe (Random, October); David Maraniss' innovative dual-track look at the Vietnam War at home and in Southeast Asia, 'They Marched Into Sunlight' (Simon & Schuster, October); and two new histories by bestselling authors Nathaniel Philbrick ('Sea of Glory,' about a 1838 exploring expedition, Viking, November) and Mark Kurlansky ('1968: The Year That Rocked the World,' Ballantine, December).   Traditional history looks good, too. Paul Fussell takes issue with romanticized portraits of World War II in 'The Boy's Crusade' (Modern Library, September). 'Refuge in Hell: How Berlin's Jewish Hospital Outlasted the Nazis' by Daniel Silver illuminates how that institution miraculously survived (Houghton Mifflin, September). Edwin Black exposes the American roots of the Nazis' nightmarish racial attitudes in 'War Against the Weak: Eugenics and America's Campaign to Create a Master Race' (Four Walls Eight Windows, September). Military history buffs will snap up Victor Davis Hanson's latest, 'Ripples of Battle: How Wars Fought Long Ago Determine How We Fight, How We Live, How We Think' (Doubleday, September).   Early word on 'Love and Hate in Jamestown' by David A. Price (Knopf, October) says this view of Colonial America is a page-turner. You can go even further back into the past with the purportedly definitive 'One Vast Winter Count: The Native-American West Before Lewis and Clark' by Colin G. Calloway (Univ. of Nebraska Press, October) or to recent times with Joseph E. Stiglitz's 'The Roaring Nineties: A New History of the World's Most Prosperous Decade' (W.W. Norton, October). One of the few Founding Fathers who hasn't been exhaustively reexamined recently is our first president; now Henry Wiencek weighs in with 'An Imperfect God: George Washington, His Slaves and the Creation of America' (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, November). Garry Wills, meanwhile, offers a controversial look at the role of slave states in the election of Thomas Jefferson in 'Negro President' (Houghton Mifflin, November).   An infamous episode in American history is revisited by Steve Oney in 'And the Dead Shall Rise: The Murder of Mary Phagan and the Lynching of Leo Frank' (Pantheon, October). Michael McGerr traces the evolution of a political movement in 'A Fierce Discontent: The Rise and Fall of the Progressive Movement in America, 1870-1920' (Free Press, September). After the release from prison of Kathy Boudin, Knopf is pushing up the publication date of Susan Braudy's 'Family Circle: The Boudins and the Aristocracy of the Left' to later this month.   If your historical interests are more international, Thomas Cahill continues his bestselling series with 'Sailing the Wine-Dark Sea: Why the Greeks Matter' (Doubleday, October). A rare cache of photographs taken during China's Cultural Revolution will be published as 'Red-Color News Soldier' by Li Zhensheng (Phaidon, September). Peter Balakian indicts U.S. inaction in 'The Burning Tigris: The Armenian Genocide and America's Response' (HarperCollins, October).   Fiction   Only time will tell if the season's bumper crop of first novels will yield any choice specimens, but readers can also take their pick from books by more familiar talents. In September, the 50th anniversary of 'The Adventures of Augie March' makes a fine occasion to revisit Saul Bellow's masterwork, and Viking is putting out a special edition of it. The fall's hottest new literary novel is Jonathan Lethem's 'Fortress of Solitude' (Doubleday), like 'Motherless Brooklyn' a paean to his hometown. Pulitzer-winner Jhumpa Lahiri comes out with her first novel, 'The Namesake' (Houghton Mifflin), and Neal Stephenson follows up his bestselling 'Cryptonomicon' with 'Quicksilver' (William Morrow), the first of a three-book series set among the scientific geniuses of the 1600s, sure to set geekish hearts aflutter. 'Paris Trout' author Pete Dexter will tell further tales of working-class heroes in 'Train' (Doubleday), and fans of the Melvillian herstory of 'Ahab's Wife' should look out for Sena Jeter Naslund's new Civil Rights-era novel, 'Four Spirits' (Morrow). 'Outlanders' creator Diana Gabaldon starts a new trilogy with 'Lord John and the Private Matter' (Bantam).   In October, Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison's 'Love' (Knopf), reputed to be her best book in years, hits the stores. Look for new novels from Steve Martin ('The Pleasure of My Company,' Hyperion), David Guterson ('Our Lady of the Forest,' Knopf), and 'Gap Creek' author Robert Morgan ('Brave Enemies,' Algonquin). Edmund White has based his latest work of fiction, 'Fanny' (Ecco) on the life of Anthony Trollope's mother, an ardent abolitionist. Booker-winner J.M. Coetzee will publish a novel with an animal rights theme, 'Elizabeth Costello' (Viking). Writers' writer Shirley Hazzard has a new novel, too, 'The Great Fire' (Farrar, Straus & Giroux), set in Asia and Europe in the aftermath of World War II. Peter Straub returns to his trademark spooky stuff in 'Lost Boy, Lost Girl' (Random), and literary writer Stewart O'Nan also tries his hand at a ghost story with 'The Night Country' (Farrar, Straus & Giroux). Two giants of the mystery genre will bring out new books: Patricia Cornwell ('Blow Fly,' Putnam) and Sara Paretsky ('Blacklist,' Putnam). Cornelia Funke's children's novel 'The Thief Lord,' was a surprise crossover hit a year or two ago; her latest, 'Inkheart,' will be brought to us by the Potter-pushers at Scholastic. And last but not least, the University of California Press will publish a posthumously recovered play by Mark Twain, 'Is He Dead?'   Popular favorites add to their ongoing series in November, notably Anne Rice giving her fans more Lestat in 'Blood Canticle' (Knopf), and Elizabeth Peters offering a guide to 'Amelia Peabody's Egypt: A Compendium' (Morrow). Stephen King begins the beginning of the end of his Dark Tower series with 'Wolves of the Calla' (Scribner). Terry McMillan will further chronicle the lives of her African-American women characters in 'The Interruption of Everything' (Viking). On the literary side, there are new novels from Booker-winners Pat Barker ('Double Vision,' Farrar, Strauss & Giroux) and Peter Carey ('My Life as a Fake,' Knopf). Jim Crace, author of 'Being Dead,' tells the story of a man who keeps fathering children in 'Genesis' (Farrar, Straus & Giroux), and Tobias Wolff's 'Old School' (Knopf) describes a schoolboy's experience meeting his literary idol. Those whose readerly appetites are whetted by literary feuds will want to see if Martin Amis' 'Yellow Dog,' (Miramax), his first novel in seven years, lives up (or down) to the drubbing it received from fellow writer Tibor Fischer in the Daily Telegraph.   Business and Money   On pocketbook issues, Pulitzer-winning New York Times reporter David Cay Johnston exposes the way the tax system benefits the rich in 'Perfectly Legal' (Portfolio, Dec.). Elizabeth Warren and Amelia Warren Tyagi look at 'The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Mothers and Their Families Are Going Broke' (Basic, September). Doug Henwood presents a left-of-center take on the recent bubble and its bursting in 'After the New Economy' (New Press, October).   In the realm of corporate misadventures, the reporters who helped expose Enron tell its story in 'The Smartest Guys in the Room: The Rise and Fall of Enron' by Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind (Viking, October). Kara Swisher offers her take on some bad business decisions in 'There Must Be a Pony in Here Somewhere: The AOL Time Warner Debacle' (Crown, October). A controversial tycoon gets the once-over from Karen Southwick in 'Everyone Else Must Fail: The Unvarnished Truth About Oracle and Larry Ellison' (Crown, November)   The Way We Live Now   Not surprisingly, this fall is packed with new books about the ongoing encroachments on Americans' civil liberties.

The state of the war on terrorism also gets several long, hard looks. Gerald Posner explains the lapses that permitted the attacks of September 11 'Why America Slept' (Random, September). Ronald Kessler examines 'The CIA at War: Inside the Secret Campaign on Terror' (St. Martin's, October). Benjamin Barber, author of the prescient 'Jihad vs. McWorld,' looks at U.S. policy mistakes that breed terrorism in 'Fear's Empire' (W.W. Norton, September). Michael Ignatieff parses some painful moral dilemmas in 'Lesser Evil: Political Ethics in an Age of Terror' (Princeton, Dec.), and two neocon players lay out their agenda in 'An End to Evil: What's Next in the War on Terror' by David Frum and Richard Perle (Random, Dec.).   Curtis White expands a Harper's essay attacking NPR's Terry Gross into 'The Middle Mind: Why American's Don't Think For Themselves' (HarperSanFrancisco, September).

Finally, Studs Terkel proffers sustaining thoughts in 'Hope Dies Last: Keeping the Faith in Difficult Times' (New Press, November) and Gregg Easterbrook explains that it's precisely when people think things are at their worst that they are actually improving in 'The Progress Paradox' (Random House, November).   Biography   Nigel Hamiliton's unauthorized biography of Bill Clinton arrives late this month from Random House, around the same time that Clinton's secretary of state (the first woman to hold that position), Madeleine Albright, will publish her own memoir, 'Madam Secretary' (Miramax).

Rolling Stone contributor Anthony Bozza describes the life and times of Eminem in 'Whatever You Say I Am' (Crown, October), and Pulitzer-winning author Robert Coles offers his tribute to 'Bruce Springsteen's America' (Random, October), while Sophia Dembling and Lisa Gutierrez put the TV shrink on the couch in 'The Making of Dr. Phil' (Wiley, October).   Literary types will be confiding in their readers, as well: Gabriel Garcia Marquez tells the first half of his own story in 'Living to Tell the Tale' (Knopf, November); Maxine Hong Kingston continues her sui generis work with 'The Fifth Book of Peace' (Knopf, September); Joan Didion dissects her California childhood in 'Were I Was From' (Knopf, September); Joyce Carol Oates offers insight into her formidable output in 'The Faith of a Writer' (HarperCollins, September); Dale Peck delves into his family's past with 'What We Lost' (Houghton Mifflin, November); and Amy Tan gets metaphysical in 'The Opposite of Fate: A Book of Musings' (Putnam, October).   If you're dead, someone else gets to set the record straight, as Geoffrey Wolff is currently doing for the late novelist John O'Hara ('The Art of Burning Bridges,' Knopf). Nathaniel Hawthrone gets a major bio from Brenda Wineapple ('Hawthorne,' Knopf, September), Mariane Pearl (with help from Sarah Crichton) writes of her murdered husband in 'A Mighty Heart: The Brave Life and Death of My Husband, Danny Pearl' (Scribner, September). Another legendary journalist, Martha Gellhorn, is the subject of Caroline Moorehead's 'Gellhorn: A 20th Century Life' (Holt, October). A biographer who's a bit of a legend herself, Diane Middlebrook, tackles the marriage of Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes in 'Her Husband' (Viking, October), and the author of '1984' gets another biography in Gordon Bowker's 'Inside George Orwell' (Palgrave, September). A very famous family gets a major multigeneration history in 'The Kennedys: America's Emerald Kings' by Thomas Maier (Basic, October). And no art lover will want to miss a great critic's book on a great painter, Robert Hughes' 'Goya' (Knopf, November)   Away From Home   Two writers put forward their arguments on the conflicts in the Middle East in 'The Case for Israel' by Alan Dershowitz (Wiley, September) and 'Right To Exist: A Moral Defense of Israel's Wars' by Yaacov Lozowick, a former peace activist turned reluctant Sharon supporter (Doubleday, September). Barbara Victor investigates a relatively new phenomenon in 'Army of Roses: Inside the World of Palestinian Women Suicide Bombers' (Rodale, October).   Central Asia is a region that's fascinating many writers these days: Tom Bissell's 'Chasing the Sea: Lost Among the Ghosts of Empire in Central Asia' (Pantheon, September) and 'The Storyteller's Daughter' by 'Beyond the Veil' director Saira Shah (Knopf, September) are two notable examples. Lutz Kleveman writes of the area's geopolitical significance in 'The New Great Game: Blood and Oil in Central Asia' (Atlantic Monthly Press, September).   Dispatches from other trouble spots include a new book from bestselling author Tracy Kidder about a selfless doctor working under dire conditions in Haiti, 'Mountains Beyond Mountains' (Random House, September). Janine Di Giovanni describes her experiences as a journalist in the Balkans in 'Madness Visible: A Memoir of War' (Knopf, November).

135,135,554681,0,45,"        Books and the single girl      BY AILEEN JACOBSON STAFF WRITER  May 11, 2004  The last time single women were celebrated in fiction, they were called New Women, says Elaine Showalter, the recently retired chairwoman of Princeton's English department. That was when the 19th century became the 20th.  Now the 20th has turned into the 21st century, and a genre concentrating on the lives, loves, adventures and misadventures of unwed females is once again booming. This time around, it's called Chick Lit.  Many of its best-selling books are wrapped in pink covers featuring swirly letters and curvy legs ending in stiletto heels - though recent trends include an expansion of the color palette.  'Aqua is the new pink,' says Sessalee Hensley, Barnes & Noble's fiction buyer, adding that lime green has also entered the mix. So has a host of subgenres, from widow lit (young woman looks again) to bridezilla lit (young woman gets man) to lad lit (sensitive guy looks for Ms. Right) to hen lit (for the more mature woman, who may conclude chick isn't such a bad label after all). 'Where does it stop?' asks Brad Parsons, a senior editor at Amazon.com. 'The umbrella is getting bigger and bigger.'  Did the women's movement ever happen?  'To feel that every piece of literature has to empower women to come out on top, well - what I write is just real life, about those days when you aren't empowered and winning corporate wars or whatever. You're losing your pantyhose and you're lusting after a bag you can't afford. I mean, there's room for both,' says author Sophie Kinsella, 34, best- known for her amusing trio of novels known as the 'Shopaholic' series.  Her current bestseller, 'Can You Keep a Secret?,' is also to become a movie starring Kate Hudson. The book - which starts with a young woman blurting out, during a bumpy plane ride, her most embarrassing secrets to a handsome stranger later revealed as her company's chief executive - comes wrapped in retro pink.  Beach reading season  It's one of a recent beach- weather-ready cluster of high- profile entries in the genre, which, most observers agree, jump-started with Helen Fielding's 1998 'Bridget Jones's Diary,' was bolstered by TV's 'Sex and the City' and has swelled to at least 240 new novels a year, according to Charlotte Abbott, book news editor of Publishers Weekly. Five mainstream publishers have established imprints specializing in chick lit, she says, and they're 'now reaching full steam, so that's pumping a lot of books into the market.' Other publishers make occasional forays.  Authors have mixed feelings about the grouping and the term 'chick lit.'  'I think a man might have invented it. I don't think girls would label themselves that way,' says Plum Sykes, 34, author of the current bestseller 'Bergdorf Blondes' - about the haute world of a Manhattan party-girl narrator who calls herself Moi, her best friend, a fictional department store heiress, and their pals, who get their tresses dyed every 13 days at the Bergdorf family store. (Publishing experts think chick lit was first applied to the popular genre in England, where it's easily as popular as in the United States.)  Sykes, a Vogue contributing editor, fashion celebrity and London-born Oxford graduate, prefers to call her first novel a social comedy, in the manner of 'Breakfast at Tiffany's.' She also likes the fashion-conscious label 'chic lit,' as one magazine dubbed it. She did research, she says, to reflect accurately the lifestyles and lingo of Park Avenue princesses: ana for anorexic or perfect, A.T.M. for rich boyfriend, M.I.T. for mogul in training, and M.T.M. for married to mogul, better than the previous two.  'I feel that most chick lit, unfortunately, is about depressed girls eating lots of chocolate,' Sykes says over a plate of one sliced apple and one sliced orange at a trendy West Village restaurant, though she admires Fielding and Allison Pearson, author of 'I Don't Know How She Does It.' On the other hand, she says, 'It's great if it helps to sell the books' by getting them to 'that huge market that Helen Fielding created sort of single-handedly.'  Marian Keyes, 40, another popular author whose seventh novel, 'The Other Side of the Story' (aqua cover), debuted two weeks ago and is expected to become a bestseller, defines a different divide, speaking by phone from her home in Ireland prior to her American tour.  'I think that the term is meant to be pejorative, to put women down: Oh, you silly little women with your silly little concerns in your silly little books. But chick lit authors for the first time are helping post- feminist women navigate this world, trying to be the best friend, have a job, have a thin body, have the shiniest hair. For the first time, those conflicting concerns are being addressed, and with humor. The term has made it easier to denigrate these books, not address their substance.'  Her newest book tells the tangled tale of three women involved in publishing and love affairs. 'The whole career and relationship conflict is very real,' she says. 'These women are looking for balance, and confused by the demands forced on them.'  Funny isn't easy  Both Keyes, whose first novel was published in 1993 (before 'Bridget Jones' turned scattered prose into a genre), and Kinsella, a former financial journalist and mother of two, point out that turning out good, funny books isn't easy. Kinsella, in fact, wrote several well-regarded novels under her real name, Madeleine Wickham, before combining her middle name and mother's maiden name into a new moniker, so as not to confuse her readers when she switched styles, she says.  'These books never get reviewed in the Times [of London], but I've put as much, if not more, time into them, and consider them as good, if not better,' than her previous novels, says Kinsella over lunch at a midtown hotel during her recent extensive American tour. Her chick lit books take 'months of planning. Plots really need to be worked out. It doesn't just sort of fall off the pen.'  Showalter, Princeton professor emeritus and author, admires the work of Kinsella, Keyes and Princeton grad Jennifer Weiner. (Weiner's 'Good in Bed,' about an overweight young woman, is being developed for a series by HBO, while her second book, 'In Her Shoes,' about two sisters, is being made into a movie starring Toni Collette, Cameron Diaz and Shirley MacLaine. Her third book, 'Little Earthquakes,' due in September, has just been purchased by Universal.) Showalter plans to read Sykes' book: 'I read Vogue. I don't see myself as above any of this.'  On the other hand, Showalter - who contributed an essay on lad lit for a 2002 Oxford University Press book, 'On Modern British Fiction' - says she thinks chick lit is developing in two directions, one thoughtful and the other commercial, such as Miramax's commissioning of a chick lit novel by Kristen Gore, Al Gore's 26-year-old daughter, to be published in September. 'They were looking for a D.C. Bridget. It's just like marketing Barbie dolls - surgeon Barbie, beach Barbie.'  However, she adds, 'With some of these writers, people will look back in a century and think, this is the way it was for young women then. Some will be ephemeral and lost. Under the guise of this rubric, some of these women are writing really fine work about what women face in these times.' She thinks some are writing work 'as intelligent and insightful' as Doris Lessing and Margaret Drabble, though lighter in tone. The New Women literature of a century ago, she adds, was also more serious, and sometimes written by men, including H.G. Wells and George Gissing.  The 'mother chick'  One writer who has been called the 'mother of chick lit' has a decidedly different view from Showalter's. Erica Jong, speaking up via e-mail, is scathing: 'Chick lit is nothing more than the contemporary version of the 'How to Get Married Novel' invented by Charlotte Bronte and Jane Austen - and done much better by them (needless to say).'  Her landmark 'Fear of Flying,' she says, 'details the disappointments of marriage and the search for freedom and individuality, while Chick Lit is a retro form that details the search for and nabbing of a husband, any husband.' Today's 20- and 30-somethings, she says, 'are looking for the opposite of what their mothers looked for. Their mothers sought freedom; they seek slavery. They want The Ring, The White Wedding, The Bugaboo Frog Stroller - and hey - let them have it all.' They'll come around as they age, she predicts.  Jong's view is 'a narrow-minded description of the genre,' says Margaret Marbury, executive editor of Harlequin's Red Dress Ink, the first U.S. imprint dedicated to chick lit when it launched in November 2001. 'These are coming-of-age stories, finding out who you are, where you want to go,' she says. Finding Mr. Right is part of that, she adds, but so are such themes as getting a more meaningful job, dealing with family and perhaps never finding someone to marry.  'One of the most powerful things about this literature is that it can hold up a mirror and make you feel you're not alone.... These books don't trivialize women's problems.' The often-pink covers featuring 'body elements or shoes or women's underwear' signal the humor and fun inside the books, she says, and also aid bookstore visitors seeking this type of novel to 'make your purchases and get out of there.'  New author opportunities  Red Dress now publishes three books a month (culled from 200 submissions each month, many through the company's Web site): one 'traditional' single-girl chick lit, one internally called 'Red Dress grows up' (for readers older than 40) and the third a 'wild card' - perhaps multicultural, mommy, lad or young widow lit.  In October, another division of Harlequin (yes, the romance publisher) will launch a chick lit series 'for modern Christian women.' The first offering, Judy Baer's 'The Whitney Chronicles,' features on its pink cover the bottom half of a woman with her skirt covering her knees and her heels more sensible than stiletto. It's about a 30-year-old looking for her Mr. Right, a 'fabulous, single, Christian man.'  'Another thing chick lit has really provided,' says author Cara Lockwood, 'is that it has given opportunity to a lot of young women writers.' Lockwood's second book, 'Pink Slip Party' ('When you lose your job, can your mind be far behind?' the cover asks), has just been published by Downtown Press, an imprint of Pocket Books, which is part of Simon & Schuster, devoted to chick lit. A former journalist who now works in the dean's office of Northwestern University School of Communications, she hasn't given up her day job. She's working on book three, which is 'inspired by my mixed-race background,' Japanese and Caucasian, 'but it's still chick lit,' a label she doesn't mind.  'I think it's great.... It's another place women can go to find things that are meaningful to them.' But she does think it 'unfair' that books that appeal to women often are shown less respect than those that appeal largely to men, such as science fiction.  Perhaps a name change is in order? Carrie Feron, executive editor of Avon Trade (tagline: '... because every bag deserves a great book!'), says her HarperCollins imprint is trying to recast the genre it publishes as metro chic. 'We just feel happier saying it ourselves.' Almost three years old, Avon publishes two to three books a month, she says, and is getting more diverse. Kim Wong Keltner's 'The Dim Sum of All Things' recounts the adventures of a 25-year-old 'Chinese-American wage-slave' who lusts after a 'white devil' in her office. July brings the debut of 'Goddess for Hire' by Indian-American Sonia Singh.  Trade paperbacks are preferred over hardcovers by many chick-lit publishers, she says, because they're more affordable for avid readers, the right size for toting to the beach, and 'more attractive' than pulpier mass market paperbacks.  That hasn't stopped Hyperion from going to hardcover with several chick-lit titles, including the recent 'P.S. I Love You,' a young-widow novel by Cecelia Ahern, the 22-year-old daughter of the Irish prime minister. Ahern has another book coming out in 2005, says vice president and publisher Ellen Archer, as does 'Sex and the City' author Candace Bushnell, whose more recent 'Trading Up' is about to make its paperback debut. (Also coming in paperback for this summer, from a different publisher: 'The Devil Wears Prada,' Lauren Weisberger's skewering of her former boss, Vogue editor Anna Wintour, along with its spawn: a host of new assistant lit books, aka underling lit.)  Archer sees Bushnell's books as 'social satire,' a label that she also applies to her company's July novel, 'Gotham Diaries,' by Tonya Lewis Lee, wife of Spike Lee, and Crystal McCrary Anthony, wife of former Knicks player and ESPN commentator Greg Anthony (who also co-authored with Rita Ewing, ex-wife of Patrick Ewing, Avon's 'Homecourt Advantage').  'Gotham Diaries' is being touted as 'an exclusive peek into the world of the super-rich, super-connected African- Americans.' Also in an upscale African-American niche is Putnam's new 'The Accidental Diva,' in which TeenPeople beauty director Tia Williams focuses on an African-American beauty editor of a top, white-oriented fashion magazine.  Barnes & Noble fiction buyer Hensley keeps an eye both on trends and on TV and movie releases - the second 'Bridget Jones,' she notes, has been postponed - because she has to make sure store shelves are stocked properly. TV's 'Sex and the City' and 'Friends' boosted the whole genre, she says: 'Once people found there are books written like that, they came back.' And now that both shows are over, 'what can they do but read?'  The genre's evolution  Chick lit is evolving in several ways. Not only is it expanding toward older readers (her summer pick in this category is the upcoming 'This Side of Married,' by Rachel Pastan) and teens, but it's also building a healthy back list. When readers discover a writer they like, she says, they go back to her previous work. The bestselling back list authors, she says, are Kinsella, Keyes, Fielding (whose 'Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination' debuts next month) and two more Brits, Wendy Holden and Anna Maxted.  Amazon's Parsons says much of chick lit is 'guilty pleasure ... commercial, disposable stuff,' while other books are more literary. Among books he'd place in the latter slot are Elizabeth Robinson's 'The True and Outstanding Adventures of the Hunt Sisters' and Rachel Cline's 'What to Keep' (both of which show a leaping young girl on their covers), and two June books, Jenny McPhee's 'No Ordinary Matter' and Bonnie Marson's 'Sleeping with Schubert.' The Marson book, he thinks, will appeal to 'chick lit and classical music fans,' especially since it has 'a really sharp cover, a drawing of a naked woman playing piano from behind, a bust of Schubert and Manhattan in the background.'  While some authors may be 'the last to embrace' the term chick lit, he says, 'it shows no signs of going away.' Adds Hensley: 'The main thing is that, despite being called chick lit, the books are really good.'

136,136,554681,0,45,"        Point. Click. Think?   As Students Rely on the Internet for Research, Teachers Try to Warn of the Web's Snares      By Laura Sessions Stepp Washington Post Staff Writer Tuesday, July 16, 2002; Page C01    It is 2 a.m. and Daniel Davis, a University of Maryland freshman, has not even started his English paper on biological warfare, due that day.  No problem. He'll just do what he has done before a dozen times or more. He sits down at his computer in his dorm room, signs on to Yahoo's search engine and begins his quest. Six hours and several bags of chips later, the paper pops out of his printer, complete.  He doesn't consider visiting the campus library or opening a book. Why should he? 'You can find whole pages of stuff you need to know on the Web, fast,' he says.  So Davis is a procrastinator. So what? Professors are used to that. But six hours? That's a whole new kind of extreme.  Welcome to the world of Net thinking, a form of reasoning that characterizes many students who are growing up with the Internet as their primary, and in some cases, sole source of research. Ask teachers and they'll tell you: Among all the influences that shape young thinking skills, computer technology is the biggest one.  'Students' first recourse for any kind of information is the Web. It's absolutely automatic,' says Kenneth Kotovsky, a psychology professor at Carnegie-Mellon University who has examined the study habits of young people.  Good? Bad? Who knows? The first popular Internet browser, Netscape, came out only about a decade ago. What we do know after millennia of training minds in scholarly disciplines is that something has changed and it's not apt to change back.  On the good side, Net thinkers are said to generate work quickly and make connections easily. 'They are more in control of facts than we were 40 years ago,' says Bernard Cooperman, a history professor at the University of Maryland.  But they also value information-gathering over deliberation, breadth over depth, and other people's arguments over their own.  This has educators worried.  'Seven years ago, I was writing about the promise of digital resources,' says Jamie McKenzie, a former school superintendent and library director who now publishes an e-zine on educational technology. 'I have to say I've been disappointed. The quality of information [on the Internet] is below what you find in print, and the Internet has fostered a thinner, less substantial thinking.'  The problem is no longer plagiarism of huge downloaded blocks of text -- software can detect that now, when a teacher enters a few lines of a paper. The concern is the Internet itself.  Marylaine Block, a librarian and Internet trainer in Iowa, is blunt: 'The Internet makes it ungodly easy now for people who wish to be lazy.'  In the Shallows   Jeffrey Meikle, chairman of the American studies department at the University of Texas, sees the new world every time he walks into the main library on the Austin campus. There, where the card catalogue used to be, sit banks of computer terminals.  'My students are as intelligent and hardworking as ever,' he says, 'but they wouldn't go to the library if there weren't all those terminals.'  All Web resources are not equal, of course.  What aficionados call 'the deep Web,' including subscription services such as Nexis and JSTOR, enables students to find information that is accurate, thorough and wide-ranging.  'I think the Internet encourages intellectual thinking,' says Nora Flynn, a junior at Maryland. 'You can go to so many sources, find things you never heard of. It forces me to think globally.'  But many students don't have access to these costly, sophisticated resources or don't know how to use them. This leaves them relying on the free Web, a dangerous place to be without a guide.  Anyone can post anything on the free Web, and anyone frequently does. A student who typed 'Thomas Jefferson' into the Google search engine would get 1.29 million hits; rap star Eminem would bring up 1.37 million. Narrowing one's search to certain words may not help. The gamelike quality of screen and mouse encourages students to sample these sources rather than select an appropriate text and read deeply into it or follow an argument to its conclusion. The result is what Cooperman, who teaches both Davis and Flynn at Maryland, calls 'cocktail-party knowledge.'  He's the model of a man of books: short-sleeve shirts, glasses, slight stoop, a pensive air. 'The Web is designed for the masses,' he says. 'It never presents students with classically constructed arguments, just facts and pictures.' Many students today will advance an argument, he continues, then find themselves unable to make it convincingly. 'Is that a function of the Web, or being inundated with information, or the way we're educating them in general?'  Entering the Web   If students cannot come up with their own ideas, cut-and-paste technology allows them to lift someone else's sentences or phrases with ease.  Jeana Davis, a ninth-grade teacher in Arlington, says students frequently don't see anything wrong with this. 'They'll say, 'I changed the words around.' And I'll say, 'But it's not your original thought.' '  Superficial searching habits can have tragic consequences, illustrated last year at Johns Hopkins University. A physician-researcher performed a test of lung function on a healthy 24-year-old woman, administering a large dose of a particular chemical. The woman then died of lung and kidney failure. The doctor had searched online for information about the drug but had failed to turn up any literature warning of its dangers -- information that medical librarians later did find online after the woman died.  Students can avoid such mistakes by asking for help from those trained to give it, but some young inquirers say they've done that and are merely waved over to the digital section of a library. Librarian Marylaine Block concedes that can happen, particularly since staff positions at many libraries have been cut.  Bonnie Kunzel, teen specialist at the Princeton Public Library, says students 'will walk into our library and spend 30 minutes on the Internet trying to find out how a cobbler worked in Colonial America. I'll walk over and ask, 'Want to try a book now?' '  When students do come across something of interest, they may not be able to detect the author's bias because Web prose, unlike the writing in serious books and journals, often appears with only the slimmest of attribution, if any. This can introduce a certain naivete into their writing.  The Net has a kind of magical quality that leads younger students to say to librarians such as Block, 'It has to be true. If it weren't true, they wouldn't let it be there.' Says Block, 'I have to tell them there is no 'they.' '  History teacher Davis, at Washington-Lee High School, recalls sitting down at the computer with a student who was researching Christopher Columbus's effect on the Americas. The student had found a convincing essay by an author taking Columbus to task for his treatment of Native Americans.  'Then we found another essay contradicting that,' Davis says. 'I asked the student, 'Who is right?' He couldn't tell, and neither could I.'  Teachers like Davis spend class time teaching their Net thinkers how to read and think more critically. 'I tell them, 'Don't take any Web site for granted. Who was the author? What authority does he or she have? Does the author have an agenda?' '  Maryland's Cooperman engaged a group of summer school students in a similar discussion earlier this month. The course was titled 'History of the Jews I' and covered the period from the Bible through the Middle Ages.  Find a scholarly article on an issue in Jewish history, he told the students, suggesting that the best way to do that would be to visit the campus library and 'touch books.'  After receiving teacher approval of their articles, Cooperman's students summarized and evaluated the articles' arguments and then used the Web to find further sources. Cooperman told them to evaluate the usefulness of the Web sources compared with the scholarly material.  Their Web work turned up contradictions, errors and extraneous material. Nora Flynn, exploring the female Talmudic scholar Beruriah, noted in class that the scholarly article talked about Beruriah as a late invention, a composite of several women scholars. Web sources that she found through the popular search engine Google referred to Beruriah as one woman, she said.  Student Lauren Steely said the Internet sites he looked at presented lots of facts but got the dates wrong. Amy Newman, researching anti-Semitism in Europe at the time of the Black Death, brought up more than 2,000 sites on Google, 'but the first 30 were useless. Just poems and songs. Then there was one story that looked like a kindergartner had written it.'  'Or maybe it was a basketball player from Duke,' Cooperman quipped, drawing a laugh from everybody who roots against Maryland's arch-rival.  Daniel Davis noted that several popular search engines place at the top of their lists the sources that have paid them the most money. This would be like a library prominently displaying only those books whose publishers paid for the privilege, and Davis knows it. But it doesn't stop him from using those search engines.  It only makes him, and young people like him, skeptical about information sources wherever they're found, including books.  'College students are quite aware that they can't trust what they read,' says Meikle at Texas. 'They're drawn to sites that are ironic or sarcastic, poking fun at perceived truths.'  Not that long ago, Meikle continues, a person who wrote a book was assumed to be an authority. 'Now, when anybody can have a Web site on any topic, then everybody is an expert, which means nobody is.'  Cooperman says this is not necessarily a good thing for students. They 'assume everyone is a liar.' Shallow thinking is one result, he says. Another is the unwillingness among some students to take a strong position themselves lest they be battered by classmates for their ideas.  Students who are not urged to 'touch books' often don't realize how much information is not on the Internet. According to Block, only about 15 percent of all information -- books, periodicals, government documents -- is found there. The full texts of articles from most academic journals, for example, are not online nor are most current books. Because of copyright laws, a lot of information may never make it to the Net, Block says, which is why she and other librarians worry about lawmakers who slash library budgets or propose eliminating libraries altogether, saying, 'Why do we need them? Everything's on the Internet.'  And so the problem feeds on itself, encouraged by legislators.  Net Gains   Even the most vocal Net critics say it has aided learning in some ways. Students no longer have to wrestle with microfilm machines or wait at the circulation desk for books placed on reserve. Instead, they wander through the information landscape. Jamie McKenzie calls them 'free-range students.' Philosopher John Dewey, the proponent of student-driven education, would be proud.  Allison Druin, an education professor who runs the human-computer interaction lab at Maryland, says even younger children can create something new on their own Web sites. In her laboratory, children ages 7 to 11 work with professors designing software that kids their age can use when querying the Internet.  'The Internet is a tool, but it's also something they can make an addition to,' says Druin. 'That's pretty powerful stuff for a kid.'  'I see kids much more able to construct on their own,' she continues. 'They used to look at us and ask, 'What's our next step?' Now we say, 'Here's the goal, here are our resources, here's our timeline,' and they take off.''  Meikle, at the University of Texas, observes the same phenomenon. His best undergraduates come up with new takes on old subjects as quickly as graduate students did years ago, he says. 'I don't think you can come up with something original unless you have an array of things to look at, and the Internet certainly gives you that,' he says. 'It isn't collaging, it's building something new.'  Book Learnin'   One would like to think that this self-confidence and creativity will produce adult citizens eager to participate in society and tackle its problems.  When Jeana Davis at Washington-Lee makes an assignment, she directs students to Web sites they might not know about but that she has already approved. If students want to use another site, they must win Davis's approval.  She requires students to use at least three books on any assignment, not including encyclopedias. She checks their work during each project, looking for originality and depth.  Cooperman at Maryland suggests books, first, to any student who asks him for help. He also offers extra credit to students who do research in the library, according to Daniel Davis, who likes getting bonus points for doing what students took for granted only a decade ago.  'Sitting in the library is a lot better than sitting on the Internet,' he says, even though he's not exactly a frequent visitor to the main campus library. 'If you go into the library, you have to take apart a topic and you become sort of an expert. Sitting on the Internet you don't actually learn anything.'  The place he does visit, as a music major, is the performing arts library. 'I can sit for hours there looking at books and things, with no particular goal in mind.'  That's post-Net thinking, says McKenzie, a realization that digital is not enough, that grazing is good, but great ideas require deep reading, incubation and contemplation. He believes today's students are headed in that direction if grown-ups take seriously their assigning, as well as advising, role.  'For decades we've been doing topical research,' he complains. 'Schools say, 'Go find out all about Molly Pitcher.' That's an invitation to scoop it up, to write stuff they already know. We should be encouraging kids to research the difficult truth. Let's tell them a woman has been diagnosed with breast cancer and has five doctors recommending different treatments. What would they do?'  But do school systems really want students using the same tools to question current proprieties and conventional wisdom? Teach kids to be critical thinkers and they'll be sending it right back at the teacher in the classroom.  There is much to worry about.  Up to a point. Libraries have a longstanding appeal that goes beyond the antique, baby's-breath smell of books and the sense of exploration, spelunking through the stacks. Few students can get through college untouched by this experience, whether they know it or not.  'There's something in a library that makes you feel like an intellectual,' said Amy Newman. 'You can wear glasses, look like Dr. Cooperman. When you read, the books have such nice writing.'    2002 The Washington Post Company          ",5873,1000,Point Click Think As Students Rely on the Internet for Research Teachers Try to Warn of the

139,139,554681,0,45,"       Publishers Weekly    Boston's Uncommon Bestseller   By Edward Nawotka -- 4/14/2003  Dennis Lehane takes life, success and the mystery genre in hand   When Dennis Lehane smiles, small wrinkles form at the corners of his mouth; his freckles rearrange. It's a dramatic difference from the scowling young man with a single loose forelock staring out from the photos on his early books: he is much better looking in person, and not necessarily the guy you would pick out of a lineup to write some of the most menacing and absorbing detective fiction in the last decade. A lot of mystery writers have based series in Boston, two of the biggest being Robert Parker and George V. Higginsbut, arguably, neither has captured the same degree of social and psychological nuance Lehane has in his seven novels so far. Now creeping up on 40 years, Lehane is starting to show a little silver around the edges of his short auburn hair. The overall impression is one of confidence and youth. Maybe it's the way he's dressed, like a college kid fresh from finishing school: in khakis, with a black blazer over a charcoal-gray merino crewneck. He may have grown up on the mean streets of Boston, but he's left them behind this afternoon.   We meet on Newbury Street in the heart of fashionable, moneyed Boston. Lehane has parked his navy blue Toyota SUV in the same parking garage where he first worked as an attendant after returning from college and graduate school in Florida. It's across the street from the original Ritz Carlton Hotel, where Lehane still knows people who have worked there since the days when the hotel owned the parking garage. As PW approaches him in the lobby of the Ritz, he's chatting to one of the hotel staff, describing a summer home he's rented and suggesting she and her husband come up for a visit.   There are few jobs in Boston for a kid with a master's degree in creative writing'The guys in the garage would give me a hard time about it'and back in the early '90s Lehane had published only the first of his seven crime novels, the best known and bestselling of which is 2001's Mystic River. That extraordinary novel described the Boston of Lehane's childhood, a place 'cramped with corner stores, small playgrounds, and butcher shops where meat, still pink with blood, hung in the windows' and where 'Days, the mothers searched the papers for coupons. Nights, the fathers went to bars. You knew everyone; nobody ever left.' The new Boston, as exemplified by the wealth of Newbury Street, is populated with the young, beautiful and well-to-do who have made their fortune in the city's tech boom (now waning) and driven property prices to among the highest in the country. 'Now that's something we can be proud of,' Lehane quips. 'We're now more expensive than San Francisco.'  Change for the Better   Boston's surface streets may have changed but in its heart, it's still an old seaport. The city is so close to the ocean that on warm spring days the scent of saltwater wafts in from offshore. But that same breeze can quickly turn into a Nor'easter. One only has to think back to Sebastian Junger's The Perfect Storm to be reminded of the sorrow bad weather can bring.   Perhaps it was from Junger that Lehane took a cue for the milieu of his seventh book, Shutter Island, due for a 150,000-copy, one-day laydown on April 15. At the center of the novel is a dramatic storm that hits the eponymous island in outer Boston Harborhome to a federal prison for the criminally insanejust after U.S. Marshall Edward 'Teddy' Daniels arrives to help search for a murderess who has mysteriously escaped from her locked cell. The year is 1954this is Lehane's first historical fictionand the stage is set for Daniels to become an unwilling participant in a government plot to manipulate innocents, murderers and WWII vets in McCarthy-era America. Suitably, Wolfgang Petersen, the director who adopted Junger's The Perfect Storm into a movie, has bought the film option to Shutter Island.   If the story sounds melodramatic, well, Lehane admits that he is heavily influenced by the movies, going so far as to call himself a 'fanatic' and citing the 1970s cult movie The Wicker Man as a strong influence on the book. One might also catch echoes of the Frank Sinatra vehicle The Manchurian Candidate or The Ipcress File, which was based on Len Deighton's first novel, or even the Michael Douglas film The Game, from the late '90s.   When PW meets Lehane, one of the first things he says after sitting down to lunch at a modest Italian restaurant is, 'I expect Shutter Island to get bad reviews.' Lehane provides a flurry of reasons for that curious statement. 'It's the first book I ever outlined in my life. I knew everything that was going to happen before it wrote it. A full third of the people who read it will figure it out before the end. The book is not Mystic River, it's something very different, and it's always a danger to change when you have success.'   Lehane needn't fear change. Early reviews of Shutter Island have been enthusiastic, including a starred review from PW. Prior to his breakthrough with Mystic River, he made a respectable living as the author of an award-winning series of five crime novels, all set in Boston and starring a pair of gritty private eyes, Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro. (The first, A Drink Before the War, was published in 1994 and won the Shamus Award for best first P.I. novel.) It was the standalone Mystic River, however, that proved Lehane's breakthrough book, spending more than nine weeks on the New York Times bestseller list and selling 100,000 copies in hardcover. The novel was recently filmed by Clint Eastwood, starring an A-list roster of stars, including Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon as three neighborhood friendsall haunted by an incident in childhood when one of the boys was abductedwho are thrown together when the daughter of one of them is murdered. The movie is scheduled for release this autumn.  No Mystery   Lehane's publisher, Michael Morrison at Morrow, calls Mystic River 'a huge leap.' He attributes some of the book's success to a new strategy at Morrow that identified Lehane's sales potential and did the right things to exploit it. 'It's a result of cause and effect,' says Morrison. 'It's no mystery.' One of the most important decisions was to alter Lehane's covers, which until then had been very dark, often using gemstone-colored type on a black background. Mystic River was given a plainer cover, with black type on a white background, that announced 'novel' instead of 'noir.'   'It was a more inviting look,' says Claire Wachtel, Lehane's editor at Morrow. The approach was so radically different that bookstores started displaying the novel front-and-center, while price clubs such as Costco and Sam's picked up Lehane for the first time.   'He'd always had good numbers and devoted fans,' continues Wachtel, 'but we wanted to keep growing his readership.' She says that the change booksellers were responding to wasn't just due to marketing, but involved the type of book Lehane was writing: Mystic River was a much more emotionally and psychologically complex tale than the Kenzie/Gennaro crime stories. Lehane had hit his stride and everybody knew it. Commenting on Lehane's decision to abandon the Kensie/Gennaro crime series, Lehane's agent, Ann Rittenberg, says, 'He's always had a distinctive writing style and, and when he told me that he was going to 'alter the face of crime fiction,' I knew he would. He's like a top athlete who because he's in shape can change his game.'  Wachtel says she knew she was onto a winner with Mystic River just as soon as 'other agents and editors started calling me to have galleys sent over.' The early buzz on the book built to a crescendo once Mystic River was chosen as a Book Sense 76 #1 pick. 'The stars just lined up,' she adds.  'I was living with Mystic River for 10 years before I wrote it,' Lehane tells PW. 'I had said everything I had to say about the two detectives and wanted to move on to something different. Ann [Rittenberg] and Claire [Wachtel] both encouraged me to do it.'  Though he describes himself as a 'control freak,' Lehane's ability to stick to the job of writing, while allowing others to lobby on his behalf, has probably been one of his biggest assets. Rittenberg says that because Lehane wasn't greedy early on, he was able to 'build' a career rather than have himself jettisoned into the marketplace with a big printingand the accompanying bigger critical and financial risks. 'His sales and his advances moved up like steps,' says Rittenberg, who sold A Drink Before the War to Wachtel for a mere $8,500 in 1993. It took until Prayers for Rain, his fifth book, before she was able to 'break the $100,000 barrier' for advances, she says. 'Dennis told me that he'd always been poor and could live that way a little while longer. I always thought he was worth more.' Prior to delivering Mystic River, Lehane's contract was for three more books and was priced far less than his current level. The quality of the manuscript prompted Rittenberg to call Morrison for a lunch to talk about Lehane's commitments to the company. 'When I told him how much I wanted, he almost couldn't finish what he was eating,' Rittenberg jokes. Lehane's renegotiated contract with Morrow, which covers both Mystic River and Shutter Island, as well as three more novels, amounts to more than $3 million, with a bonus promised if the books meet sales goals.   Cause and Effect   There's an old saying that goes, 'Money doesn't change you, it just gives you the opportunity be the person you really are.' So what is Dennis Lehane like after all this heady critical and financial success? Apparently, he's not much different than he was before finding his name on the New York Times bestseller list. He still lives in Boston with his pair of bulldogs, Marlon and Stella. He still writes at least three drafts of each novel, the first by hand, the second on the computer. He still listens to music when he writesrock for action sequences, classical for the more contemplative scenes. (For Shutter Island, he listened to Sinatra singing Rodgers and Hart). He still has the same group of friends he's had since childhood, guys who are blessed with having their names immortalized as drug dealers, murderers or other criminals in Lehane's novels. According to him, the one concession he's made to hitting the A-list is buying a new pool table (an eight-foot competition model) and a wide-screen plasma television.   After spending an afternoon eating and drinking with Lehane, it's evident to PW that the author remains as down to earth and as dedicated to writing as the master's degreewielding parking garage attendant he once was.   His modesty as an adult may be a result of his modest upbringing. Born and raised in Dorchester, one of the poorest Boston neighborhoods, Lehane was the youngest of five children of a pair of Catholic working-class Irish immigrants from Cork. His first book was the Bible. 'I read it cover to cover. It was cool,' he says without irony. 'If you singled out the times in Mystic River with religious symbolism, I mean you're practically in a Scorsese film.'   As a teen, Lehane's dream was to become a writer. During his childhood, Lehane's Boston was not the cozy, overpriced college tech-town it is now. Instead, it was a racially divided, parochial city suffering from poverty and drugs. During the era of forced busing (memorialized in Anthony Lukas's book Common Ground), violence ran rampant. One of Lehane's friends was murdered during this time, and the first thing the future writer did when he got the chance was to get out: after dropping out of UMass Boston, he moved to Florida, finishing his B.A. at Eckerd College in St. Petersburg and then taking an M.F.A. from Florida International University, where he studied with novelist John Dufresne and mystery writer John Sandiford.  In college, Lehane learned how to write. 'John Dufresne is one of the great writing teachers,' he says. 'Dufresne calls fiction 'the lie that tells the truth.' ' Although Lehane doesn't say so, it's clear that, after an extended writing apprenticeship with the Kensie/Gennaro series, it was in Mystic River that he at last fully embraced Dufresne's dictum to tell the truthincluding the traumatic truth of the emotional aftermath of his own difficult youththrough fiction.   Lehane has been so inspired by his experience in writing classes that he's begun teaching them himself, first at Tufts University and later this summer at the Harvard Extension School. 'I had some really good teachers and I try to give back, you know, send the elevator car back down. It's great to see someone who has got the chopsmaybe they're six years, nine years away from publicationand be able to tell them 'stay on the road, you're going to make it.' ' He adds that if anyone comes to one of his classes looking for a how-to on how to write a bestseller, he tries to 'scare them right out the door.'  Lehane doesn't have much time for the high/low debate that has created two opposing literary camps over the last 40 years. 'You can't separate characterwhich is what the higher set championsand plotwhich is what the other side defends. They are both in service to each other,' he says with a hint of exasperation. 'If you go to any great work of art, you talk about plot all day and then you talk about character all day. Just give me a well-written book.'  Both Mystic River and Shutter Island deliver on this demand. For his next, Lehane is promising a trilogy that begins in 1918 with the Boston police strike and traces the reverberations it had in American society. 'The strike changed everything,' he says. 'It had a big effect on the unionization movement, and Prohibition came on the heels of that, then Calvin Coolidge promising to break the unions. That's all linked to what's going on now.' Lehane describes it as a five- or six-year project. 'It'll be an epic about small-scale violence,' he says with finality.     2003 Reed Business Information            ",5643,1000,Publishers Weekly Boston's Uncommon Bestseller By Edward Nawotka Dennis

146,146,554681,0,45,"        Jane Juska is my hero...   April 27, 2003  Sex and the Single Senior  By ALEX WITCHEL   People smile at Jane Juska. There she is, on a rainy afternoon at the Gramercy Tavern in her cheerful red jacket, white hair tucked behind her ears, blue eyes bright behind her bifocals. 'I'm agog at the forsythia,' she exclaimed, marveling at the enormous arrangements. At 70, she seems to be what she is, a proud new grandma enjoying a day on the town. Though she clutched her lower back periodically  arthritis?  she ordered some wine and chatted happily about her writing. Here's a sample:   'Before I turn 67  next March  I would like to have a lot of sex with a man I like. If you want to talk first, Trollope works for me.'  And how. Ms. Juska placed this personal ad in The New York Review of Books in the fall of 1999. Over the course of a month, she received 63 responses and spent the better part of a year following them up, an experience she recounts in her first book, 'A Round-Heeled Woman: My Late-Life Adventures in Sex and Romance' (Villard). It turns out that Ms. Juska did indeed have a lot of sex with a lot of men she liked, and still does, having seen one of them as recently as that morning. He's 35. Which might explain the lower-back problem.  'I didn't want to think, `What if I never had sex with a man again?' ' Ms. Juska recalled of her decision to place the ad. 'I didn't want to just sit there and think, `Wouldn't it be nice, if?' '   Ms. Juska, a retired high school English teacher (round-heeled is an antiquated slang expression for a promiscuous woman), was moved to action after seeing Eric Rohmer's film 'Autumn Tale.' Its plot involves a woman placing a personal ad in a newspaper on her middle-age friend's behalf.  'Before I got home I had written my ad in my head,' Ms. Juska said. 'But I did think, as if I were teaching a class and would ask my students, `What harm might this decision cause other people?' The only person that would be is my son. So I asked him, and he said: `Go get 'em, Mom. It's your turn.' The night I sent the ad in I felt so great.'  Feeling great has become a new hobby for Ms. Juska in the 10 years since her retirement. She now lives in Berkeley and has lived in the Bay Area since the mid-1950's. After her divorce in 1972, she raised her son, Andy, now 38, as a single mother with no help from his father, she said. 'My ex-husband wanted me to just collapse intellectually,' she recalled. 'Whether the topic was the weather, politics or rent increases, he was always argumentative.'  She went through a bleak period during which she gained 70 pounds, drank heavily and lived in constant turmoil when her son dropped out of school and ran away from home. It took years of psychoanalysis, dieting and exercise to take control of herself again, shaking off the lingering effects of a Puritanical small-town Ohio childhood in the process.   For 27 years, she dated only sporadically. 'Except for a couple of unhappy skirmishes, my relationship with men was nonexistent,' she said. 'I had enough trouble making a living, bringing up a son. Romantic trouble? That was too much.'   Her work, she said, was her salvation. 'Teaching was a passion for me,' Ms. Juska said. 'And when I left it, I just wasn't tired enough.' She smiled. 'My grandmother used to say, `Don't borrow trouble,' but I think borrowing trouble is a good idea. If you live your life staying safe you're going to lose.'  She ate her lunch with great appetite  beet salad, lamb shank, sorbet  and finished every bite. She needed to keep up her strength; after lunch she was headed to New England to meet another gentleman friend she met through the ad.   Well, let's get down to basics. Some postmenopausal women feel a lessening of sexual desire, or at least are said to. That was apparently not her experience. 'No,' she said firmly. 'I was probably even more interested because I wasn't as afraid as when I was younger, of not doing it right or, well, being thought randy.'  But even women who are 20 years her junior might not feel keen to take off their clothes in front of men they don't know. And Ms. Juska describes her own imperfect body in exacting detail in her book. Was she not at all self-conscious?  She smiled, sort of. 'Men didn't mind,' she said. 'It was always me pulling up the sheet and turning out the light. I never met a man who was afraid to take his clothes off. That's healthy, I think. They've forgiven themselves for sagging here and there.' She took a deep breath. 'The other day, my publisher sent me for media coaching, where they tape you so you learn how to speak on television,' she said. 'I don't feel 70, but I look it. Television does not lie. I went home after that and cried.'   She cried over a few of the men, too, one in particular, with whom she fell in love. 'In the end, he was just lonely and wanted a friend,' she said. 'So he strung me along, and I let him, I guess.' Some of the others weren't too swell, either; one stole her underwear. And her Champagne flutes. But she seems remarkably sanguine about the entire endeavor. There is so much of the teacher about her, you can practically see her internal filing system for categorizing learning experiences.   Her humor, however, helps lighten the load. When asked whether she practiced safe sex, she said: 'Well, not getting pregnant was part of my popularity,' though she added: 'Yes, we took the precautions we thought we needed to. After all, these men didn't know where I had been, either.'  Although Ms. Juska has never published a book before, she has published articles on teaching, and for 20 years has been part of a writing group that meets monthly to read each other's work. It was when she was making piles of 'yes,' 'no' and 'maybe' with the responses to her ad that the idea of writing about it came to her. 'I thought: `Jane, you don't want to forget this. It's too good to keep to yourself.' ' she said. 'I thought I'd write it as a novel because nobody would believe it. I took some vignettes to my group, and after I read them they were silent. I was terribly uncomfortable. Finally, there was a comment: `You changed point of view on Page 3.' They were just fumbling for things to say.'  One of the men Ms. Juska met through the ad asked to see her pages. (In the book, all the men's names, occupations and home cities were changed to protect their identities, which Ms. Juska still refuses to divulge). She recalled: 'After he read what I had written, he said, `There are two things you must do. Get out of that writing group and write it as nonfiction.' He gave me permission just to go.'  Without any connections in publishing, Ms. Juska sent out the manuscript on her own. At the William Morris Agency, Elyse Green, a 26-year-old assistant, fell in love with it. 'I didn't know agents had slush piles but they do,' Ms. Juska said. Ms. Green passed the book to Virginia Barber, who became Ms. Juska's agent.  Ms. Juska sent her son the chapter she had written about his troubled youth and told him he could change his name if he wanted anonymity. He is now a forester, and though he eventually returned to school he has never shared his mother's love of words. 'He said, `I would be proud if you used my real name,' ' Ms. Juska said. But wasn't she worried about his reaction to the rest of the book? She laughed. 'He said, `Oh, this is just another book I'm not going to read,' so I'm safe.'  She finished her second glass of sauvignon blanc. 'The best part of all this is that I have a writing life now,' she said. She is working on a second book, about teaching. 'The other huge surprise,' she said, 'was finding intellectual partners, which is almost as exciting as the sex, in some cases more. To be able to talk to a really smart man, who says, `I would value your opinion on this.' Where I grew up you had to bow and scrape to the nearest man and keep your mouth shut.'   But it has been women, not men, whose responses to Ms. Juska's adventure have been the most harsh. 'I did a reading in Berkeley for mostly women,' Ms. Juska said. 'I said that the age range of the men in the book went from 84 to 32. And one woman said about the 32-year-old, `He must have been short and ugly.' I said, `Actually, he's tall and handsome.' Another said, `Then what would he want with you?' She shrugged. 'When women in particular hear about what I've done, the question which unbidden comes to them is, `What have I done with my life?' ' she continued. 'And lots of people at my age don't want to go back and look at it. That's why they're so nuts about their grandchildren. It keeps the focus off them.'  Ms. Juska said she knows other women her age or older who have tried their luck online, at match.com. 'One woman I know is just infuriated because she met this very nice man online who turned out to be 84 and he hadn't told her. I said she was ageist and she said she was only mad that he lied. And I said, `Come on now.' But most of the women insist on asking me, `Didn't you really do this because you wanted to get married?' Ms. Juska shook her head. 'The institution of marriage does not interest me,' she said firmly. 'I did get a marriage proposal, but I said no. I'd have to give up the others, then. I'd have to give up too much.'  Still, due to the luck of the draw, most of the men who interested Ms. Juska did not live in Berkeley or anywhere nearby. When she first placed the ad, she was so busy  teaching writing to prisoners at San Quentin, teaching an education seminar at a local college, volunteering at Planned Parenthood, hiking, singing in a chorale  it seemed incredible she had time or energy for anything else. But, as she writes, by 7 each evening she was home alone. 'Yes, I was busy, but there's nobody touching you,' she said. 'People don't pay attention to that part.'  And that lack of local company persists. For all her enterprise, on most days she still lives a solitary life. So does she feel cheated by her search, in the end? She hooted her no.  'I had no hope of it turning out to be anything like this,' she said. 'I expected to be murdered, or made sad at the very least. But I never expected to have intimate friendships with extraordinary men. True, I've met some men who are not kind or thoughtful, but I've also met men who are kind and thoughtful and funny and true.' Her smile was wry. 'Which is to say, I guess I found out that men are people.'  She leaned over then to pick up her napkin and said something that was muffled. What was that? She sat up straight and spoke quite clearly. 'They're just the kind of people I like better naked,' she said.

147,147,554681,0,45,"        A Tax Dodger Meets the Man    By Nancy McKeon Washington Post Staff Writer Sunday, March 7, 2004; Page F01   Some people define themselves by their job, some by their hobbies, yet others by their family relationships. Josh Kornbluth and Richard Yancey are two very different men who can be defined, at least in part, by the Internal Revenue code.  Kornbluth is a West Coast writer/performer who, in his twenties, worked office jobs to pay the rent. At some point he dropped out of The System and, even though he temped for a tax attorney, didn't file tax returns for seven years.  Yancey spent those same years in Florida, and he too bounced around from job to job, trying to be a writer. He wound up -- until four months ago -- a revenue officer for the IRS, spending his days going after people like Kornbluth.  Tax dodger, meet tax collector.  Kornbluth was in Washington last week performing his monologue 'Love and Taxes' at Arena Stage (through March 14). Yancey was in town promoting his new book, 'Confessions of a Tax Collector' (HarperCollins). Here, in this edited transcript, they interview each other.  Kornbluth: Your book is really a story about becoming a grown-up.   Yancey: Yeah, a coming-of-age story. The IRS just happens to be where I come of age.  Kornbluth: I picked up on that right away because, in my show, we're actually telling a very similar story. Although we are, like, point-counterpoint, as we're being set up here. But as you describe yourself, you're pretty much a slacker. [Grins]  Yancey: Oh, yeah. I was a ne'er-do-well in the classic sense. If there was something to fail at, I could achieve that failure. By the time I got into the Service I was 28 and I didn't know what I was doing with my life. I didn't have a life, I didn't know what I was doing.  Kornbluth: You were the antithesis of what you were about to become. It's as if the car thief became the repo man.  So what was the job like?  Yancey: It was a lot of things. In some ways it was a terrific job. We had fun, especially in the early '90s before Congress ruined everything and put all these inhibitions on the IRS. [Laughter] We had a blast, and every day was different.  Yancey tells of a married couple -- apparently tax protesters -- who owed about $20,000 after failing to file for three years. They had no real estate in their names. Their 1989 truck had a large note on it. Only a 1968 Chevrolet Chevette had no lien against it. No way was Yancey going to get the government's $20,000 by seizing that.   Yancey: That car's basically a little box on wheels. But I thought, I gotta close the case, so I'll go out and get the Chevette. I knew where he worked, I knew he probably drove his car to work, and so I go there and was cruising his parking lot, three or four times. I can't find a red Chevette anywhere. Then I stop and I see this For Sale sign on a car. And it's a cherry-red '68 Corvette, not Chevette. It's a classic, in mint condition, worth back then, what, $70,000? $80,000? Within 10 minutes I had a tow truck there. The guy comes running out of his office, and the tow truck driver says, 'If he's got a gun, you're my human shield. Stand there!' Anyway, we hooked it up, we took it in. I didn't get to sell it, though -- the guy came up with the money.   It kind of illustrates the real lesson I learned in the IRS.  Kornbluth: Which is?  Yancey: Which is how to control and manipulate people, which really didn't have anything to do with the power of the federal law that I had behind me. It had to do with learning how to push people's buttons. What I learned was, First you find what they love and then you take it. If you can't find what they love, find what they fear and exploit it.   Kornbluth: In your book, the [IRS interviewer] asks you, Why do people pay their taxes? You give the 'right' answer, which is due to their patriotic duty. And he says, No, it's fear. Is that where it comes down?  Yancey: That's my experience. I can't tell you how many people, when I knocked on their door, said, 'Are you here to arrest me?' And when everything was done, they would say, 'I can't believe a person from the IRS is, like, a human being.'  But when you were going through this ordeal, how were the IRS people in general? Were they the typical, you know, pocket protectors?  Kornbluth: I didn't actually -- what I did was, I called. First, I avoided.  Yancey: That's common.  Kornbluth: . At first I was working almost entirely at jobs that had withholding tax. I filed, and I got refunds, but then someone told me I was supposed to itemize, because I was also writing freelance. And I couldn't: I looked around and everything would look like a deduction [laughter] and I didn't know how to deal with it. Not only that, but I couldn't find things -- under socks, or KFC boxes.  Yancey: That sounds just like me. Oh, yeah, I'm a terrible organizer. I can't keep track of papers -- no, I was good at work. When I had to be, I was.   Kornbluth: Yeah, I recognized a fellow spirit. And I was around the age that you're talking about too -- I was in my twenties then. So anyway, I just fell out of the system. I had an appointment with a tax person, a preparer, and on April 15 I was scrambling and then I just overloaded and I got really sleepy --   Yancey: Sleepy?  Kornbluth: Yeah, sleepy. And I needed to lie down on my receipts, and when I woke up it was the 16th. Just like that. And I just couldn't -- it was late -- and then, nothing happened.  Yancey: Nothing happened?  Kornbluth: Nothing happened. And so I continued to let nothing happen for seven years, until I was a secretary for a great tax attorney. And I was doing a show about, in part, how I hadn't done my taxes for seven years, and he said, 'That was a very funny joke, Josh,' and I said, 'Well, it wasn't a joke,' and he flipped out and sent me to a tax lawyer. And that's why I started dealing with it and going inside the system.  I wasn't trying to get away with anything. The tax lawyer said that if I had filed I would've gotten refunds. But then I made a little money, for me a lot of money, $50,000 over two years 'cause I had movie options for my monologues. And then, instead of another refund I owed $27,000. So, at first I just wasn't thinking about it. Then I was thinking about it, it was on my mind all the time. I had been filing for years and then I stopped. So I eventually called the IRS, and they were really nice. I was on hold a lot, but I will say that, the music on hold, I found very relaxing.   Yancey: [Laughing] Really?  Kornbluth: But as I put in my Social Security number, my heart was pounding and I thought, 'What is that person going to say, like, 'You're going to jail' ?' But at the same time, I really had the inkling -- and I'd be curious from your end -- the inkling of, I owe this. [Laughter]  Was it your experience, or did you have any connection with whether the money you were being sent to collect was a fair assessment of these people?  Yancey: I never got into that unless they brought it up.  Kornbluth: That wasn't your job, right? Your job is like, 'Rick, go, get that money.'  Yancey: No one ever called me -- well, some CPAs would call me by my first name, but most people wouldn't. And I didn't even use my real name.  Kornbluth: Oh, that's right! So, that's something I wondered -- so the woman I talked to on the phone was named Mrs. Williams --   Yancey: [to laughter] Yeah, right!  Kornbluth: I suspected that maybe it wasn't. So I was right about that?  Yancey: Well, on my level they don't release 'this percentage of employees are using pseudonyms,' but I made a personal choice and we're allowed to do it. I mean, I worked with people like you, but I worked with some real bad guys. There are those who openly flouted the system, who were, like, I know I owe this money and I don't care, I'm just not going to pay you. And plus questioning the legitimacy of the tax laws, just in general --   Kornbluth: Which, from my reading, is stuff that's thrown out whenever it gets to court, right?  Yancey: Yeah, but that doesn't stop some people --   Kornbluth: Well, there's the Flat Earth Society people too.  Yancey addresses some of the people he dealt with in his career, many of whom seemed never to have had anything and yet wound up owing the IRS thousands of dollars.   Yancey: Most of it came about through self-employment, where people are basically living beyond their means, they're not thinking when they get a check that part of the money belongs to the government.  One of the nice things about being a wage slave is that your employer is going to pay half of your Social Security tax. When you're self-employed, like you and I are, you're responsible for the whole thing.   Kornbluth: Yeah, independent contractors, the self-employed, need to put the money aside. People like us, who are not by nature responsible, not dedicated to details, need to learn that. That's what I did. I didn't attend to it, I didn't put the money aside, and then I owed it, and then it got bigger and bigger. But that's not the IRS's fault.  But the tax attorney was great. And I picked up a lot of the language, like the shotgun provision and the classical corporation ruling and the reverse double dummy maneuver.  Yancey: What's that?  Kornbluth: It had something to do with, you set up these sort of companies that are sort of -- well, I'm not the person to explain it. Nonetheless, it's a maneuver, it's legal, or apparently, and it's a great name I like to use in my show.   Yancey: I guess a lot of professions are like that. You have your own language, your own culture. And I get this pang [about the IRS] that I'm going to miss it. Sometimes, I feel, I need to be in the know.  Sandy [his wife] is still in the Service, so she can talk about some of these things. I mean, she can't give names, but for instance, she's training five new people and that helped me bring up the feelings that I had when I was in training that I talk about in the book, these feelings of being overwhelmed and learning a whole new language. I mean, you're pulling your hair out thinking, 'I'm never gonna get this,' but then you have an epiphany, something clicked at one point.  And all of a sudden you find yourself rattling off sections of the [tax] code. And, to get back to language for a second, in the IRS we don't call taxes taxes. They're not taxes, they're modules.   Kornbluth: So you're not really dealing with tax evaders. You deal with module evaders.  Yancey: Right, module dodgers.   2004 The Washington Post Company     urlLink A Tax Dodger Meets the Man (washingtonpost.com)          ",5184,1000,A Tax Dodger Meets the Man By Nancy McKeon Washington

157,157,554681,0,45,"        Film directors don't always play by the book  By Claudia Puig, USA TODAY  Andre Dubus III can't believe his good fortune that Ben Kingsley is starring in the movie version of his novel, House of Sand and Fog.   Novelist Andre Dubus III said he had Ben Kingsley in mind for the character of the Iranian emigr when he wrote House of Sea and Fog.     'My wife and I were just talking in a fantasy way: If this were a movie, who would you see?' says Dubus. 'Right away, I saw Kingsley.'  For his part, Kingsley read the novel, found it 'crushingly sad,' and moved on to other work. 'It didn't haunt me.'  Still, he took the part.  'Andre's wife wrote to me and sent me a copy of the book 18 months before it was even considered to be a film,' says Kingsley, who is getting Oscar buzz for his portrayal of Massoud Behrani, an Iranian colonel who emigrates to the USA but struggles in his new country. 'She very sweetly said, 'No strings attached.' Simply stating the fact that her husband had always envisaged Behrani as me, that I was the scaffolding for the building that was Behrani.'  At least nine filmmakers are using successful novels as the scaffolding for their films this month. While there's nothing new about adapting books to the screen, this season has a flurry of them. Master and Commander, Mystic River, The Human Stain and In the Cut are in theaters now. The Missing, starring Cate Blanchett as a woman who turns to her estranged father to find her kidnapped daughter in 1880s New Mexico, opened last week. Still to come:  Big Fish, starring Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor in a story of a man coming to terms with his storytelling father, who is dying. Dec. 10, New York, Los Angeles.  Girl With a Pearl Earring, starring Scarlett Johansson as a servant who catches the eye of artist Vermeer, played by Colin Firth. Dec. 12 in New York and Los Angeles.  House of Sand and Fog, starring Kingsley and Jennifer Connelly. An immigrant sees a house as the realization of his dreams, but it has been wrongly taken from a woman who saw the house as her last hope. Dec. 19, New York, Los Angeles.  Cold Mountain, starring Nicole Kidman, Jude Law and Renee Zellweger. A wounded Civil War soldier makes an epic journey to reunite with his sweetheart. Dec. 25, nationwide.  Basing a movie on a well-known novel has its perils. Despite a built-in audience of readers, there's always the possibility fans will dislike the way characters they've imagined are portrayed. But if successful, the film portrayal of a literary character can make a character even more indelible  as Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable become the personification of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler in the movie based on Gone With the Wind.  'If you're adapting a novel that's both widely read and intensely loved, you have a certain responsibility,' says Peter Webber, director of Girl With a Pearl Earring, based on the best-selling novel by Tracy Chevalier. 'It's also really scary because everybody who's read the book has cast it in their head. Your version has to be more effective than their version. That's a tall order.'  The cinematic embodiment of characters has sometimes proved controversial, as with Anthony Hopkins' role in The Human Stain as a light-skinned black man, and glamorous Nicole Kidman playing a janitor. Anne Rice famously blanched at Tom Cruise being cast in the movie of her novel, Interview With the Vampire, but recanted when she saw the film.  'People quarrel with every incarnation of a book on film,' says Anthony Minghella, who wrote the screenplay and directed the movie based on Charles Frazier's best-selling Civil War tale, Cold Mountain. 'And that's their privilege.'  Sometimes casting choices are made that authors did not envision, but then realize enhance their work. Novelist Thomas Eidson was thrilled by director Ron Howard's choice of Blanchett to play the lead role in his western thriller, The Missing, based on Eidson's novel, The Last Ride.  'Cate Blanchett has so much of my sense of Maggie that it almost startled me,' says Eidson.  For some, total immersion   Actors vary in their use of the source material to inform their portrayals. Firth, who plays the Dutch painter Vermeer in Girl With a Pearl Earring, read the novel closely. When author Chevalier came to the set, 'I pounced on her and picked her brain.'  Firth explains: 'I absolutely got consumed by a desire to discover something about him. I went to look at paintings and read what I could and did as much painting as I could do. I referred to the script, the book, to pictures. It was like a candy store. You do all this stuff and in the end, I don't know how much of it makes any difference to anyone watching the movie. But it made me enjoy it.'  Johansson, who played the title character, made a conscious choice to trust her instincts.  'I did not read the book before or during filmmaking,' she says. 'It's written in a first-person narrative from my character's point of view. I just didn't want to be told what I should be feeling at a particular time.'  Johansson read the book after the film wrapped.  'I was dying to read it,' she says. 'We had a copy of it on the set, and it was very tempting. I would start to look over some dialogue, and my eyes would wander over to the page and then I'd go 'No! Stop reading!' '  Kingsley called upon the cultural expertise of Jonathan Ahdout, the 14-year-old Iranian-American who plays his son in House of Sand and Fog, and the boy's family, to flesh out Behrani.  'Behrani has nothing to do with me or my experience,' Kingsley says. 'It's wonderful to take that leap into the unknown.'  Similarly, directors choose their own approaches to adapting books to the screen. Some, like Webber, keep the novel as an ever-present guide on set.  Others, like Minghella (who also adapted The English Patient and The Talented Mr. Ripley into movies) don't refer to the book during its cinematic adaptation.  'I have a quite radical but well-intentioned and perhaps foolish method of adapting, and I hit upon it with The English Patient, and I'm now doing it perhaps also out of superstition: I don't take the book with me when I go to write the adaptation,' says Minghella. He holes himself up to write at a house in the English countryside with a piano and sketchbook nearby.  He explains his strategy: 'Cold Mountain is a poem which changes chronology and voice and perspective. If the screenplay tried to follow too closely, it would be absolutely impenetrable.'  'I won't change the ending'   Though novelists may not be involved in the adaptation process, some insist upon a shared vision with the director and screenwriter.   Movie vs. book portrayal   Ben Kingsley, House of Sand and Fog Book by Andre Dubus III, 100,000 paperbacks in stores, Back story of Colonel Behrani's life in Iran and political past is just implied in the movie   Cate Blanchett, The Missing, based on The Last Ride by Thomas Eidson, 100,000 paperbacks in stores, Very true to the book; Tommy Lee Jones' character's past is more fully explored in the book   Albert Finney, Big Fish, Book by Daniel Wallace, Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportions, 75,000 paperbacks in stores, Finney's character in the book was a serial womanizer. In the movie, that aspect of his character is not depicted   Colin Firth, Girl with a Pearl Earring Book by Tracy Chevalier, 500,000 paperbacks in stores, Firth's Vermeer is informed by his research on the artist. The movie doesn't age the characters, as the book did      Dubus said he had received more than 130 calls from filmmakers inquiring about adapting his book, but he was always disappointed when they wanted to make a substantive change he couldn't support.  'They'd always say 'That ending is so terrible, can we change it?' I'd always say I won't change the ending to make it more palatable.'  Finally, director Vadim Perelman promised: ' 'I will make the movie that was the book,' ' says Dubus. 'I knew I was in good hands.'  It helps if the filmmaker has a connection with the material.  'Big Fish hit me very strongly,' says director Tim Burton about the novel by Daniel Wallace. 'I was immediately taken by the fact that it put an image to things that are quite difficult to discuss: the relationship you have with your parents.'  The prolific Burton (Edward Scissorhands, Planet of the Apes, Beetlejuice) chose for his first adaptation a slim volume about a charmer who tells tall tales but can't get close to his son.  'To turn a really well-known novel that's 400 pages into a movie can be quite daunting and may rub people the wrong way,' says Burton. 'Because this wasn't a really well-known novel, or that long, this seemed not quite as daunting. The book was more like a blueprint for what (screenwriter) John (August) did with the script. If I had read the book first, I would never have said, 'Movie.' '  And though the movie has substantive changes from his book, Wallace believed the alterations were wholly necessary.  The main character in Wallace's book is based on his father, a larger-than-life businessman who is dying. The character's womanizing was softened for the movie. And, he says, Finney's characterization 'had a more patrician Southern quality (than my father), but his upper-class kind of feel works with the movie completely.' Finney captured the mellowing that occurred in his father's final days, he says.  'Big Fish, the book, is not as plot-heavy as the movie is,' says Wallace. 'But the difference between the movie and the book is necessary. It's like changing a fish to a mammal. You can't expect it to be the same.'  Imposing an artistic vision on a well-known work is 'not just a filmmaker sucking the life of the book,' says Minghella. 'All readers are filmmakers in a sense. Reading is personal, particular and wonderful and it's not for me to say my version is definitive. I'm just going to my inner screen and sharing it.'     urlLink USATODAY.com - Film directors don't always play by the book          ",5511,1000,Film directors don't always play by the book By Claudia

164,164,1151815,1,25,"       The Brewery - Main Room(#1215RJMs)          A light murmur of voices often can be heard upon entrance to the pub, everything from politics to the sports game shown on the television to the side of the bar. Tables rest in a pattern that would only make sense to a designer cursed with insanity and hatred of servers. There are several tables that line the wall in which the main door rests, but as they come to the door, they arc out onto the main floor and dissolve into a jumble of wooden chairs and formica tabletops. Yet, perhaps to aid those seeking certain tables, each tabletop bears the image of a certain logo for a type of beer. One can see a chubby weasel caught in mid-flight with the words 'Fat Weasel' written underneath beside the more traditional logo of Budweiser. This bit of kitsch is forgone, though, when it comes to the bar itself. The bar is made of solid oak and polished until it holds a warm glow. This glow is constantly sustained by the rag held in the hand of the harried soul tending to the drinks and woes of the patrons of this establishment. The occasional waitress and more intrepid soul can be seen venturing near the strange cauldron forged of shining steel and stranger intent. There is a spigot on the side from which those waitresses who dare its shining bulk draw its blood to serve to those of adventurous bent.         There is a door set in the back wall. A door that bears a white sign which states that none may enter. Still, waitresses and the bartender can be seen making their way to the door and slipping beyond. These journeys into the forbidden are brief, but always do those who return from its hidden wonders bear a broad smile and a pair of mugs filled with liquid gold that go only to patrons who seem to bear friendship and/or kinship to the staff of this establishment.                           >                            Contents: Anastasia Morgan Lily Nathan Obvious exits: Back Room    Out    Morgan is looking at you.  Nathan is looking at you.  In the far corner of the room, Anastasia pulls a book from her satchel out and sets it down. WHen a waiter finally comes by her table, she simply says, 'Tea,' in a barely-breath of whispery voice. She could well stare holes into the man's back as he departs, waiting to get him away from her.  Pobble saunters into the pub, coat pulled tightly about him to relieve the outside chill. He pauses near the entrance, sidestepping to avoid becomming a barrier to further entrance and slumping just a touch. After stiffling a yawn he begins to pick his way across to the counter.  Lily is looking at you.  Morgan hrrms as Ana enters, watching her settle and brusquely request tea. He then watches the polar bear that is Pobble make his way to the counter, but the scrutiny doesn't last long, strangely enough, but then again, look how ~he~ is dressed! Either a Fair employee or a SCA freak, who knows? He returns his attention to Lily and Nathan. for whom he makes room for upon settling at Lily's table.  Anastasia is looking at you.  'Good, then you haven't yet heard the unflattering ones.' Nathan says with a quick grin before moving away from the bar towards the table in which Lily sits. 'Thank you, my dear lady. Let me introduce myself. I am Nathan de Laval, and as you said, tailor by trade while finishing my degree at the university.' When he reaches her table, he offers his hand to her, glancing towards Morgan as the other takes his seat. For now, the entrance of Anastasia goes unnoticed, as does the strangely dressed Pobble, his attention upon the two before him.   Lily considers Nathan's outstretched hand warily, as if the tailor might be concealing a rabid, starving Doberman up his sleeve, but shakes nonetheless, though her grip lingers in his only so long as the absolute minimums of courtesy demand. Not one for touching, our Lily; she flickers a fainly apologetic smile to him, murmuring, 'Lily Black, florist. A pleasure to meet you. Will you join us?' She darts a look at Anastasia, adding a respectful nod, but makes no motion to disturb the other woman; Pobble's coat receives the fleeting hint of a grin.  Pobble settles against the counter, using it to hold up his tired weight as he scratches his chin and waits for service. Coffee is ordered, and a silver nail is rapped against the bartop quietly as he waits. Attention flicks across the room from table to table, searching for the familiar and pausing in places. Such as the dashing rogue, Lily and finally stopping with Anastasia. Beverage arrives, and the blue haired gent begins to spoon in an abundance of sugar.     ---------------------------------[ Glance ]---------------------------------    Pobble..............Tallish, thin guy.

And sighs again. And Ana looks towards the table where the others are, and sighs. And she looks to her hands, and suddenly decides she'd better do something with them. So, she pulls out a chessboard from her satchel and sets it down. Some frat boy a few tables over starts cackling at something on TV, and the sound causes Ana to almost jolt in her seat, and she spills a few of the chess pieces on the ground. Hurriedly, she stoops to get them.  Pobble finishes spooning and stirring in time to observe the peices clattering to the floor. Carefully taking up the mug he makes his way across and sets the coffee down on Anastasia's table before crouching to assist with retrieving a stray bishop from behind the chair opposite the woman. Offering a smile of greeting he deposits the peice on the board and gestures to the chair, 'May I?'  'I was going to play chess,' answers Ana blandly, her voice a dull and emotionless tone. 'But that can wait. Have a seat, if you wish, Doctor. I might have to look at things, though, on the chessboard as we speak, so I hope you do not get upset with me.'  Pobble quirks a brow in query but slides down onto a seat, resting elbows on the table and centering his coffee. One settled, he raises the mug to softly blow ripples across the surface of the liquid as he looks across at Anastasia curiously. 'I have some news..' he begins.   At your table, Anastasia answers, immediately, and she takes her glasses off, looking at you with those intensely focused grey eyes. 'News? Oh yes. I have some news too, but I suspect you may already know it, so I hope you'll forgive just some curious girl for not being so efficient.'  At your table, Pobble smirks as he blows the coffee, setting the cup down as he stares back across at you. 'Of course, you're just some curious girl.' he observes wryly, wiping a trailing drop of brown liquid from the side of the mug before it hits the table. 'Did you want to start or should I?'  Lily sits down at table in the corner.  Nathan sits down at table in the corner.  Never let it be said that Nathan isn't a gentleman, even when the lady proves to be so.. shy. For the moment she takes his hand, he bends over it, kissing the air above before letting it go, his smile once more easy upon his lips. 'The fair Lily. I have heard a touch about you too, and your way with plants.' With the offer of a seat, he looks from her to Morgan, as if to be sure all is ok before accepting with a grateful look. 'Thank you both, don't mind that I do.' The books gain a look of curiousity as to what the woman might have been studying, yet be it against his ways to ask outright. The mug in his hands gains another sip as he settles into the seat offered.  At your table, Anastasia replies softly, 'Well, I could tell you what I learned, or you could tell me what you learned, but I don't want to speak of things here. He's a wizard - he could be listening anywhere, you know... and even I would be hesitant to risk that.'  At your table, Pobble nods slowly, finally taking a sip of the steaming brew before he replies. 'Indeed anywhere, so how would you get around that?' he asks with a crooked smile, as if having ideas to this end but more interested in entertaining suggestions.  Lily's eyes widen almost comically at Nathan's courtly display, and she rubs the back of her hand in surprise. 'I...oh.' Ah, yes; how articulate. 'Plants, yes.' She offers another shy smile, hiding again behind her glass of liqueur. She lowers her voice, then, to converse at the table.  At your table, Anastasia toys with something on her shoulder, nothing there, but maybe is fixing her bra-strap. 'What about that office?' she asks, seeming to be hesitant - and though the chess game is not set up, she certainly seems like she's playing it alraedy.  At your table, Pobble's gaze flicks across to the office, and he seems intrigued. 'You work here or something?' he asks, looking back to you sidelong. Finger curls through the mug handle, rotating the cup about in place.  At your table, Anastasia looks over there, and suddenly, turns back to you, her eyes narrowing a little. 'I meant yours.' She's peppering words around, seeing what you'll pick up, and what you won't.  At your table, Pobble shrugs just slightly, response delayed by the consumption of coffee. Keeping it held before his face he regards you over the rim with a half-smile. 'That office is no more secure than this place.'  Anastasia narrows her eyes at the man across from her, and seems utterly frustrated. WQuickly, and with only the words spoken, 'I shall return,' she pushes herself away from the table, stands, and turns to stride decidedly across the room to the tall SCA guy.  Pobble seems oblivious to the frustration and settles back, holding mug with both hands in his lap as he watches Anastasia head off to the other table without a word.  Morgan orders honey liquor himself, the only popular brand being Baronjaeger for some odd reason. Bah, American paletes. He looks up as Ana approaches him, nodding to her briefly, taking in her countenance.  Nathan settles, then falls into quiet conversation, the mug lifted to his lips and sipped from at times as he banters back and forth with both Lily and Morgan. The smile never leaves his face, growing at times with amusement.  Anastasia folds her hands before her waist and starts to speak softly to Morgan, looking back over to her table.  Morgan arches a brow, then whispers back to Anastasia.  Anastasia answers to Morgan, flatly, 'No. But that is not a thing to worry about. If anyone asks, they can speak to me directly as to my rationale. Thank you, and good day.' Just as quickly as she approached, the strange girl turns and starts back towards her table.  Nathan glances up as Anastasia arrives to the table, giving her a respectful nod before she begins to speak so quietly with Morgan. As they talk, he turns back to continue the conversation with Lily.  Morgan arches both brows now and lets them settle, but he's not going to dwell on it. He lets Ana go as she came, returning his attention to his companions.  Pobble watches with the faintest hint of a smile on his lips between sips from his cup. He's half done by the time the woman returns, waiting while he pushes his beverage from side to side idly. As Anastasia reapproaches he raises a questioning eyebrow.  At your table, Anastasia settles down again, and sighs heavily. 'I suppose we can do that,' answers Ana, who pushes her hair out of her face, and reaches for her satchel. 'But would you first be so kind as to help me to carry my things? My shoulders are rounded from all of this walking with these books.'  At your table, Pobble drains the last from his cup and nods, 'Why of course Miss.' he says, pushing back his chair before stopping and tilting his head, 'Do what though? You say that as if I made a suggestion?' Phineas comes in to the bar, folding an umbrella up under his arm and adjusting the muffler he has around his topcoat. It is chilly outside, and it threatens rain.  Pobble sits across from Anastasia although he appears to be making ready to stand. An empty coffee mug sits before him and he seems to be too absorbed with his conversing to notice a new arrival.  Morgan sits with Nathan and Lily, drinking and conversing quietly.  At your table, Anastasia pushes a few books to you. There is a notebook, a small organizer, and the strangest of all, a largish old tome, something musty with cracked bindings. To those that are magickally aware, there is something extra about it - it seems imbued with a magick all its own. 'Just those, please... I think I can handle the rest.'  At your table, Pobble doesn't appear to notice anything untowards about the books and trails a silver tipped fingertip across the strange tome before sweeping up the pile and holding them against his chest with both hands as he stands.  [FAE] Pobble glows briefly as he is enchanted.  Phineas wanders to a small table by himself. After all, you have to get warmed up a bit before you socialize.  Phineas sits down at table by the door.           Eyes, sharp and grey, shaped like rose petals, are piercingly deep, taking in the world around her with cool calculation and profound intelligence, yet bearing a sparks of electricity - quick and vibrant.. This noblewoman fae is an embodiment of mystery, reminiscent of the glow of moonlight through foggy summer nights . A sparkle of diamonds against the midnight, her hair is a glittering deep violet hue, striped wide with shimmering silver streaks. Her hair is an array of tiny, thin braids, most of which are let to fall loose to her shoulders and reaching to mid-back, but with still more twirled up into a topknot and held in place by two onyx chopsticks. A ringed headpiece formed of delicate strands of twining mercurial tendrils rests above her forehead, an irridescent halo for a circlet. The circlet holds a glittering gem that reflects a spectrum of colors, depending on the light, set into a silver filagreed frame and resting just above her brow. This sidhe, like most of her kith, stands tall and proud, at nearly six feet tall but with a frail, limber frame. Her skin is ivory smooth, gentle and white, which stretches over her high cheekbones, broad forehead, and ears which taper out about two inches from the sides of her head into pointed tips. Those grey eyes seem to have stormclouds hidden in their gaze, ever shifting and sparking in their patterns. However, they are partly obscured by a tiny pair of silver-rimmed spectacles, half-moon in shape, perched upon the bridge of her slightly upturned nose. Her lips, soft and pink, seem to have a secretive smile to them, and her gaze seems to usually be partly on that which is at hand, and mostly somewhere else, as if daydreaming.          Her body is dressed simply - well, simply for one of her kith, as it were. Rich silks in purple and silver, softer than the wings of a butterfly, drape over her frame, gathered tightly below her slight breasts with a silver cord,and then allowed to flow down to the ground, concealing her feet. The cuffs of her robe fall just to her wrists in wide bell-like flares, decorated with embroidered roses and vines in silver thread. A silver crescent moon clasp, the traditional symbol of the noble house Eiluned, holds the black cloak that wraps loosely around her in place. The cloak she wears may appear just simply black at first, but at a closer look, you can see the stars glowing against the night-sky silk, sparkling dots that shine luminescently, even in the dark, and in perfect celestial patters, reflecting the map of the heavenly sphere.  >  At your table, Anastasia rises, without a second thought as you take the book, and simply says, 'Come. We have things to talk about.' Now it's on her terms, though, and she doesn't have to feel so awkward about her mortal body.  Pobble stands with a pile of books held in his arms. One moment he's smiling, the next he looks deeply confused. Glancing around the room with a look of realization that's not far away from 'God, I left the gas on'. Temporarily forgetting where he was heading to he looks across at Anastasia, narrowing his eyes as he tries to say something without taking a breath.  Morgan turns to look again in Ana's direction, nodding at Pobble.  [FAE] Morgan, a blue skinned, horned giant, with a 6+ foot long sword strapped to his back and a mouth full of canine teeth, nods to Pobble.  Lily's gaze lifts from her conversation to study Pobble, and her features still, schooled to impassivity.  [FAE] Lily, skeletal and shadowed, stares at Pobble without expression, offering the barest hint of a nod. Amusement shows in her gaze.  Nathan turns as does his tablemates, golden eyes finding the strangely dressed man standing near Anastasia's table. A quirk of a brow, and then he turns back to his conversation with the fair Ms. Black, laughter given by something said earlier.  Phineas is watching the table where the man is standing up, but Pobble is not object of his attention. Anastasia gets a smug little wave of recognition.  Pobble recovers from his momentary lapse of reason, patting the books in his arms with silver tipped fingers. He sways a little unsteadily, sniffs a few times and shrugs. Pupils that were wide to begin with look about the room intently, as if an earlier ingestion of chemicals had found its mark and he chuckles quietly to himsef, offering a finger waggle to the other table.  Anastasia reaches for her satchel and then, with her free hand, tugs at Pobble's coat. She looks over her shoulder, though, and stops moving for a moment. 'Actually... ' She starts biting her lip, though, hard, staring toward Phineas, whom she almost immediately spots. She doesn't reply to that wave, but says, 'I have a better idea.' Wihtout another word, she heads for the door, turning from time to time to look at Pobble, making sure he is coming along.  Anastasia pages: and since you're enchanted, you would know WHY she is reacting like that. Phineas has an air about him that is as chill as a bitter winter wind. Anastasia pages: very uncomfortable.  Pobble turns slowly and plods along after the departing woman, studying her back and clothing intently. Passing Phineas he gives the man a strange look, hugging his books tighter as he hurries on after his companion.  Phineas says, 'Be seeing you, Miss Dvornik, on campus. You enjoy the night, eh?' He watches the young lady leave. 'I am still waiting.'  'Fuck off,' states Ana, as blandly as any other word that comes out of her mouth. Her distaste for the man is evident, though, despite her emotionless tone. Now, for those who know Ana - her cursing like that - that's just unheard of. Jaws may now commence dropping.  Anastasia pushes open the door that leads out into the world and steps across the threshold as the door swings quickly shut in their wake.  Anastasia has left.  You push open the door and step out into the world to see...  Suburbs - Oak Parke(#710RJs) -= Gregor and Bard =-          A virtual smorgasbord of shops line the street, everything from the eccentric store that only the most daring of youths dare venture into to the more conservative clothing shop that declares that they have the best deals. One corner of the road has two rival tattoo and piercing shops. Whenever one declares their shop to be the best, the other counters with similar claims. There are photos of their work blown up in display windows, changing from day to day to the joy of window browsers.         The sidewalks are in decent condition; though they do show some of the wear and tear of age. The street itself is in much of the same condition, asphalt showing potholes every so often. The local politicians, of course, have declared that they will have better roadways soon enough available to motorists.   Contents: Anastasia Obvious exits: Dian Cecht DCI  The Brewery TB East on Gregor E  South on Bard S  North on Bard N  Pobble follows, seeming vaguely sympathetic and at the same time enraptured by the current goings on. He asks no questions as he follows after you, but does at times hold the books with one arm and attempt to reach out and touch the cloak..  [FAE] Anastasia's robes sweep at her feet, and she turns to look at you... everything seems like it's going in slow motion, like a really good hallucinogen. 'Dr. Steve... I'm sorry... I couldn't stay with that man in there. We need to go someplace safe. I would like to go to the forest, as I have a friend out there who may be able to help.'  Pobble's nose wrinkles at this, but he still seems captivated as you turn to look at him. Plastered with a strange lopsided smile he nods to aquiesce, 'That sounds reasonable..' he states finally, once he's noticed that he was staring.  [FAE] She pushes some braids out of her face and nods, 'Well, I don't know about taking you to my home... the others there might object, as things are very, very tense right now. And I couldn't stay in there... Forest. That is the best option, and I know of places where we will be safe to speak. It isn't far. Just a walk to the south.'   Gabbi State Park - Hiking Trails          To the north, the trail grows wider just as the trees grow more and more thin. However, to the south it is a completely different stories. The vegetation grows more and more dense, covering both the ground and the sky, as branches from trees intertwine around the pathways.          People can still often times be seen making their way through the pathways, although not as often as they are up to the north, where the entrance of the state park actually lies. Various small animals become more numerous as well, peeking around the corners of trees, under a bush, or in the branches. If one is particularly lucky, they may even catch sight of a white-tailed deer that moved farther to the north than most of their kind.   Contents: Anastasia Obvious exits: Southwest    North    The woman seems to know her way through the woods, those woods that seem to just tingle with life, and those woods in which the occasional gnome tugs at your pant leg, or pixie tugs at your hair. Ana is very nonchalant about it, brushing them off like little gnats.'  And she comes to a stop. 'Here. Here will be fine. I apologize... again, I could not let that awful, cold man know my hideouts.'  Pobble seems torn between the protrusion of new and fantastical fauna and the woman who leads him through their midst. He comes to a halt nearby and sets himself down on a decaying log. Still gazing he finally says, 'What makes him so cold? He was.. disconcerting..' He shivers, pulling his yeti coat tighter about him.  'He does not believe in magick, and is a cold product of this modern world, of soulless and passionless doldrum. He is one who is the antithesis of wonder, he is stark, cold and rationalizes anything he cannot understand away... and for that, he is painful to be around,' explains the sidhe, who now spreads her robes to settle on the grass, in a nice little patch. She draws her legs up under her, in a lotus position, and takes a few deep breaths. 'This... this is much better.'  Pobble looks around pusing his lips, 'I am still not so sure.' he says distantly, and after setting down the books on the log he retrieves a pad from his pocket and scrawls on it. After a moment of silent scribbling, punctuated by distractedly looking up at you, he nods. 'Can never be too certain..' he says, studying the surroundings and pulling a vial from a deep inside pocket. Standing he heads off to a certain point and lets a drop of the clear liquid fall to the ground. Facing you, he heads in a circle, counting steps. While this could be some excuse to get a look from all angles he does seem to have some other plan in mind.  Now, Ana is certainly the curious fae. She watches closely, turning her head and then her body to follow your steps. If she can get away with going for it, she'll try to get a drop of liquid from the ground onto her fingertip, to examine it.  Pobble almost frowns at the trapping of the drop, but replaces it after finishing the circle. He seems to nod at something and deposits a drop on his own fingertip. The vial is sealed back up and replaced and the Doctor lights up a cigarette, closing his eyes as he takes a long slow drag.  Pobble rolls 3 (3 dice) at a difficulty of 5:      2 Achieving 2 successes, resulting in a moderate success. Pobble rolls 3 (3 dice) at a difficulty of 5:    -1-   Achieving 1 successes, resulting in a marginal success. Pobble rolls 3 (3 dice) at a difficulty of 5:  2     Achieving 2 successes, resulting in a moderate success.  Anastasia puts the drop to her nose and smells it, then darts out her tongue to take a tiny taste, then rubs it around in her fingertips, to get a feel for it. She's curious, ya know. Now, she turns again, and watches closely, intently. Little does she know what she just did.  Pobble holds a breath in for quite a while, finally exhaling and opening his eyes in time to see the ingestion of hallucinogenics. He tries his very best to stiffle the emerging grin that fights its way onto his lips. 'I guess in a way, that is only fair.' he observes.  Anastasia rolls perception+kenning (6 dice) at a difficulty of 6:      5     5 Achieving 4 successes, resulting in an exceptional success!  Of course, it won't hit her for another hour, and since she has never tasted this before, she has no idea what it is. She peers a little, and asks, 'What did you just do?' It's not just the liquid. It's the feelings of weirdness she's getting from the air around you.  Pobble settles back on the log, tapping his cigarette and dispersing a small pillar of ash to the night breeze. 'Just made sure that it'll take more than casual effort to observe us.' He seems to notice that he's still staring, and does try not to, but can't really resist. You don't get to see this every day. At least, not until the hallucinogens kick in. 'I made the trees dream that we're not here, and this is what they'll report.'  Anastasia's eyes peer oddly at you, and she now seems a bit uneasy. 'You ... made the trees dream?' She's not so sure about how well she likes that. The sidhe draws her knees up to her chest and leans forward, eyeing you carefully. She curls her ears outward, and then cranes her head, to look around, to see if anything is different. Just ot be sure, on her part. 'Alas,' says the fae, 'If the trees cannot hear us, then perhaps it will be well to speak. And since I brought you here, I shall share with you what I have first.' She draws a breath, and states, 'The wizard is close to finishing his murders. Very close. But, while this may seem as good news, it is not. Once he finishes, he will have all he needs for his ritual.'  Eri comes into the area from the southwest. Eri has arrived.  Though she tries to keep things understated and quiet, there is no mistaking this woman for anything other than a Sidhe. She stands tall, just a few inches shy of six feet, and manages to make her presence known without saying a word. It's easy to find fairer specimens of her Kith, but that innate quality all of them have still puts her beyond what most mortals can hope to attain. She has an athletic stance and looks to be in good shape. Hanging at her right side is a long, sturdy sword wrapped in a leather strap. The pommel is shaped like a falcon and enameled with the familiar green and gold.  Her hair is a startling color somewhere between bright gold and vivid red. She keeps it swept back into a sleek, heavy braid that ends between her shoulder blades. A few locks hang loosely and sweep her forehead and prominent cheekbones. A very thin, twisted gold circlet graces her brow, melding nicely with the color of her hair. Her eyes are a pale, leafy green flecked with gold and her skin is a darker shade of peach, the mark of someone who spends a lot of time outdoors. She has the typical upswept, angular features and sharply pointed ears of her Kith.  Her voile is all dark woody browns and forest greens. She wears a pair of trousers made from a thick, soft cotton dyed rich, ruddy brown and a plain, long-sleeved tunic in ivory. Over the tunic is a hard leather breastplate, carved with a swirling leafy pattern and fitted to her feminine shape. Pieces of light armor are strapped here and there, used as greaves over her boots, plates over her thighs, and shoulder guards. The armor is dark green and produces a gold sheen when it catches the light. It's hard to tell what it's made of at first glance, an unusual metal perhaps? Closer inspection reveals it to be some sort of chitinous material, like it was scavenged from an oversized insect. Over all is a soft green cloak. Anastasia is seated on the ground, her knees pulled to her chest and speaking softly with Pobble. She just finishes laying a few soft words down, before she goes quiet again, watching him with an introspective thoughtfulness.  Eri is looking at you.  'To summon the Devourer of Souls.' Pobble finishes as he exhales with a haze of smoke. 'He will need the soul of a magi to finish his work however..' He adds this almost uncomfortably, tapping the side of his cigarette suggesting a mild anxiety. He draws again, long and slow. 'I tried looking into the waxworks, but it'll take a little more effort.' The Blue Haired Yeti man is sat upon a log, staring at Anastasia quite intently as he speaks, oblivious to any folk along the path.  'Nyarlathotep, as I said to you in the library... why would he do this, though? To what purpose would one bring such darkness into our world?' Pobbly may be oblivious, but Ana sure as hell isn't - in fact, her head almost immediately turns in the direction of the footsteps. She puts a finger to her lips, and says in barely a whisper, 'Ssh.'  Eri walks back down the trail, her footsteps surprisingly light and causing little in the way of disturbance on the forest floor beneath. As she approaches, she glances up and blinks at the pair not too far off. Pobble is eyed again, and she peers at him for a moment before a quirky smile starts to spread across her face. She doesn't seem to have heard the whole conversation, though, and she clears her throat gently as she draws closer. 'Hello,' she murmurs, first to Anastasia, then turning her curious smile on the Yeti-man.  Pobble's head snaps around at the sound of another voice and while initially suprised simply at the occurance of an intrusion, sighting the woman his mouth opens just a little wider - smoke drifting out. He seems to be relaxed by something, but he peers across rudely, looking the newcommer up and down. 'Eh, hello there.' he states finally, letting out a low breath. It all seems to be getting a bit much for him and he places the cigarette between his lips, reaching into a pocket for something or other.  But when Eri approaches, so does Ana rise, and she lifts her dress a little, to dip into a curtsey, and speaks a polite, 'My Lady,' to Eri. 'I hope my presence here with my companion is alright. We needed a place to speak privately, and noplace in town was suitable,' she states, her voice soft and thoughtful, but making a point to explain the presence of a stranger so far out.  At Anastasia's style of greeting, Eri's eyes flash open wide in alarm and surprise, apparently not expecting it, and she double-takes at Pobble. Ah, a closer second look explains things. Her shoulders, covered by chitinous armor in her mien, droop in relief and she nods, smiling a little lopsidedly at Anastasia. 'I see. Yes, of course,' she murmurs, waving her hand. Then, giving a smile to Pobble, she bows her head to him, keeping her gaze fixed on him the entire time. 'A pleasure.' Straightening up, she says softly, 'Well, I don't wish to interrupt your conversation. I should be getting back soon anyway.'  It seems that Pobble doesn't really know what's going on. Ladies and curtseys are above him, but at the greeting from Eri he seems to think it fitting to offer some manner of half bow, as much as he's able from his seating poise on the log. 'Indeed M'Lady.' He sounds almost like Dick Dan Dyke adressing Mary Poppins. He stops rummaging in his pocket, thinking the better of things with new company and just taps his silvered nails together with a strange hard sound in the quiet night air. With nothing else to add right now he just looks between the two Ladies with a wonderous expression, trying to fit this all into some kind of sense.  Anastasia gestures to Pobble with a sweep of her hand. 'The dark wizard who we have been hunting, m'lady. This man can help us,' she states, directly, her voice bearing a strength and solidness of surety in this fact. She turns to Pobble and says, 'Meet the Baroness, Lady Erianthe.' Poor Pobble. His brain must be as fried as Ana's will be shortly. Ana swiftly faces the other woman and says, 'This is Doctor Steve,' and gives Pobble a nod.  'Doctor Steve,' Eri echoes as she looks to the blue-haired man in the white coat, her words broken by an unintentional, good natured laugh. Then, more seriously, 'Well, I'm glad to know we have more allies...' As her words drift off, she peers at Anastasia, hard, and then smirks faintly. 'You've been working with the prodigals on this problem, haven't you? You're part of the group I've been passing notes to.' She says this as a statement, not as a question, her tone amused. The wry set to her mouth makes it looks like she thinks she's been had.  A Baroness eh. Steve seems to think he should stand. Everyone else is doing it, so why not? This done, he's still at a loss, the conversation drifting over his head and his expression suggests that on some level he's jumping with a badly constructed net, trying to grab it and bludgeon some meaning from it. He flashes one of his more charming smiles when Eri addresses him, then pulls the last from his cigarette and brings up a foot to stub it on the sole of his boot. Right now, he has nothing to add so he just holds the cigarette butt behind his back with linked hands and stares at the women.  'M'Lady,' she replies, her tones even-tempered and thoughtful, 'Of course I could not pass up a stroke of good luck that fell in my path; I would hate to offend good Fortuna,' and she looks up towards the sky and smiles toward it, giving the goddess a nod. She comes back to the here and now, and then blinks, looking between them suspiciously, her eyeballs ping-pong back and forth, pursing her lips puzzledly.  Eri's mouth still has that wry twist to it as she eyes Anastasia. Looking back to Pobble, she peers a little at him, as though weighing his character. 'Well, my lady, you probably know more about this than I do. And what irony, that I get the blame for the waxworks still standing, and not telling your good Baron all I know, when there is one in his house who is far closer to the problem than I.' Her eyes twinkle at Ana, then, and she smirks. 'No fear. Your secret is safe with me.'  She frowns somewhat at all of that, and states directly, earnestly, and with a bit of heaviness in her tone, 'M'Lady, there is nothing that you know that the good Baron does not know, and did not know first... save for my association with the good doctor, here. I am looking at the ultimate goal, and politics and personal grudges bedevilled - It is far more important that this wizard be kept from completing his ritual than are our fragile and ephemeral egos.' Damn, Ana. Your tone has gone almost completeley to scolding, though it's a general scold on all of the silly fae. 'Doctor,' she now says, facing the man, 'Do you know of the spheres? And of how his victims die?'  Pobble remains in place for a while, but decides to settle back down on the log. He brings his hands around to the front, now free of the filter and probably hoping that no one noticed its discardation. He doesn't seem to bothered by the inspection he's recieving as he shouldn't since he's doing plenty of inspecting himself. Indeed, due to inspecting he doesn't even realize he's been spoken to for a short while. Sound catches up with thinking and he starts, looking to Ana with a sheepish little smile that fades as the meat of the question is realized. 'His victims do not die. They are brutalized by the waxworks and then absorbed.. I'm guessing that he uses the statues for storage of their souls. Which is of course, what the whole beef is. Six hundred and sixty six souls.' A slow nod follows, all smiles gone far away.  Pobble's remarks don't seem cause a reaction in Eri, other than a mute, grim nod. 'Yes, it's what I've been saying to everyone all along. I mentioned this just the other day, Lady Ana,' she murmurs. Something in her is dark, disquieted and she grits her teeth, gaze dropping to someplace in the distance.  'Not the statues,' corrects Anastasia, 'I witnessed firsthand the couple murdered at the park, Doctor, as they died,' and then stops herself, 'Well, not firsthand, but through my arts, but it really is all the same,' she states. This part, she starts to say faster, her voice getting excited, in quite the same way that Velma from Scooby Doo does when she figures out who the man in the boogyman costume really is. She rushes, quicker and quicker, until she's almost tripping over her words, 'The wax figures melted out of the sky above them! They did! Just came out of the sky! And... and they ... they held these small spheres to their victims! Little black marbles, so they seemed! And.. and the souls were just drawn up into those things. The creatures melted back into the sky, and the victims bled to death, just HANGING there... dead... on crosses... oh my god, I can almost see them now...' She squeezes them shut, as if to block the images away, and she shivers.  Pobble peers at Anastasia, perhaps not linking earlier events with current agitation. 'Once he has a magi soul to finish the collection, some Very Bad Shit will happen.' This is most definately the Trademarked variety of Very Bad Shit. At least he's stopped staring and is now introvertedly considering the situation. 'We have a few ideas, but need to investigate the waxworks further. One of my colleagues has been inside the statues.. it ain't so pleasant.' Silver nails tap together with a metallic sound. 'Supposedly the Devourer of Souls, or Nylarathotep.. will erase all the light of creation.' Another slow nod, 'Maybe the statue of The Black Pharoah is related to the ritual in some Lovecraftian throwback way.'  While that simmering, brooding anger was broiling just under the surface in Eri before, the description of the deaths of those people gets her to stop, softening her anger just a little bit. Her gaze flickers as the details wash over her. Then quietly, she whispers harshly, 'No. More. Investigating. This place goes down in the next forty-eight hours. If someone else prefers to do it, I will let them, but I will take a torch to the place myself if I have to. Mr. Shobaz has already taken the liberty of informing me that his ritual is complete. He requires the last piece, and I aim to see to it that he does not have that opportunity.'  The younger sidhe draws slowly out of her little scary place, and eyes Pobble, 'Yes... so I too, have known one, a fae, too, who has been into the other realms through his keep.' Ana starts to bite her lip, then she smiles all too broadly, which is likely not appropriate at all for the heaviness of this conversation. She's still kind of stammery, though. 'The pharoah is the obvious answer, is it not? And being that he seems to me to be one completely pretentious asshole, he'd likely use it, too. Fucking spook.' Her voice getting faster, more uneven in its speaking, halting occasionally, as Ana peers up towards the trees for the words, 'I told the Baron that.. They are not ready to act, though. They do not believe the threat is that close. Fools.'  'I think..' says Pobble slowly, pulling from his pocket another cigarette. This one however is crooked and wrapped in blue paper. 'That burning down the house will do no good at this stage. He's not stupid enough to leave his work in such a visible place..Maybe.' He falters, looking across at Ana and a peice falling into place. He smiles lopsidedly despite the seriousness of the situation, looking sheepish as he sparks up his bluestick. There is a pungent aroma as he continues, 'I don't think it'd be that easy. He'll be no pushover.' Words are spoken distractedly as he studies Anastasia. 'I have a..' Again he pauses, looking almost shy for the briefest moment, 'Friend who was studying his craft there.. Maybe she'd have an idea of the rest of his place. After all, it could be that his ritual is there, but also somewhere else. Or maybe no place at all.'  'Put that away,' Eri says flatly, deadpan to Pobble, pretending not to look directly at the blunt, but straight ahead. 'And he's working on some sort of... thing... under tarps in the lobby of his museum. And I've heard mention of objects that are tied into this, but I haven't found out any more than that about them. I'll find the contact there.' Any more she's going to say is cut off by Anastasia's strange behavior. 'Are you okay?'  Anastasia has suddenly become quiet interested in her cloak. She holds it in her hands, and is running her fingers along the stars, poking at them, and saying softly, 'Rigil. Siruis. Betelgeuse...' Her other hand is rubbing the fabric in slow circles, seeming to just delight in the touch. She looks up slowly, and her heavy eyes with the quite large pupils stare blankly for a moment, and then she closes them, nodding towards Pobble, 'You are most correct, there, too. I say, for starters, we create as much havoc around the museum as possible. Police. Fire department. Water mains breaking. An elephant loose from the zoo and shifted through the spacetime contiuum to that exact, /PRECISE!/ point, right above an unsuspecting tourist, on whom it will fart, and terrify to a near comatose stupor. And then... THEN, my friends,' she sweeps, riding on some sudden inspiration, 'Then, we go after the statue, his balls, and the whole Sha-boz!' She's practically whooping. Damn, she does love it when she gets a good idea. She bobs her head at Eri, 'Oh yes. I'm doing /great/.'  Pobble looks sidelong at Eri as he pulls on his blue stick. It seems to be needed, hands were on the verge of shaking. Still, some people don't like it. Those same people walk around in insect armour in the woods. It's all reasonable, right? He stubs the thing for now, carefully and sets it down besides him, looking disgruntled. The mood doesn't last as he's taking up in the amusement of Anastasia's rant. 'Eh, yes. There are plenty of options.' he agrees, 'Whatever is done, will be difficult. I have no idea what he's capable of, but would guess at it being 'A Lot'.  Eri catches the look from Pobble and fixes her attention on him. Her mood is already dark regarding other things, so that gets unintentionally shifted to him for the moment. 'As far as my job in the forest goes, I'm still a cop. If someone walks by, they're going to see a Park Ranger standing here doing nothing while people break laws around me. Just don't do it where I can see, okay? And don't burn the place down either.' She says the last not as though she'd believe he'd do that, just sort of darkly humorous. Looking back to the raving Anastasia, she peers at her, hard, then pulls back. 'I think I'm going to go have a chat with a certain someone about other business. Would you care to be there, or would you like to come along?'  Anastasia gasps out, and her eyes widen and she freezes in panic. 'Oh... ohmigod, no... no, please no, M'lady, good Lady, good Baroness, please don't get me in trouble with the Baron for telling you these things...' SHe looks completely terrified at the thought, and hurriedly, she grabs Pobble's arm and yanks on it. 'Do something. /Please!/' As if anyone with any rational sense in their heads would know that htere is little that Pobble could reasonably do.  All that Pobble can say is, 'You're a cop?' incredulously while looking at Eri. 'I guess Park Rangers really get some whacky gear in case of emergency..' After a whistle, he peers back at Anastasia and pats her hand supportively. The fact that he's clueless isn't lost on him. Still, he puts on a better smile and beams it at Eri. 'What she said? Please?' he asks, feeling somehow honour bound to try and do something or other.  Eri frowns at Anastasia, half in confusion, half still upset about other things. 'I've been betrayed by your Baron, Lady Ana. Completely and utterly. I intended to remedy this situation. If you like, I'll tell him I forced the information out of you. Let him take his anger out on me for that.' To Pobble, she says tiredly, her voice low, 'Look harder at me.'  Nothing in particular stands out about this woman. She could be considered either completely ordinary or somewhat pretty, according to one's tastes. Her skin is peach-hued and freckled, a feature highlighted by constant exposure to the sun. She doesn't seem to find a need for makeup, but she looks decent enough without it. A crease or two on the outside corners of her eyes marks her as being a bit beyond her mid-twenties, possibly in her early thirties. She has hazel eyes and mousy brown hair. The hair is kept back in a braid that ends between the shoulderblades. She has prominent, upswept cheekbones and a slightly pointed chin, giving her an angular look.  Her height is more impressive than her looks. She stands just a few inches short of six feet, emphasizing her lean shape. Though light, she has an athletic stance and very little bodyfat. Her arms and legs are well-toned and look as though they are used to being put to work. Her nails are kept clean, clipped short, and unpolished.  Right now, she's dressed in the uniform of a Washington State Parks Ranger; a khaki button-down shirt tucked into olive green denim jeans. Over the shirt is an olive green quilted jacket, good for keeping the rain off, with a brass nameplate over the left breast pocket and official-looking patches on each shoulder. Her only adornment is a thin gold chain that hangs inside her shirt, held down by a hidden weight. The jeans are held up by a wide black leather belt that also holds a utility knife, several other small black leather cases, and a walkie-talkie. On her feet is a pair of old black hiking boots.  'Ohs' silently after staring his hardest at Eri. This does seem to take a bit of getting used to. He alternatives between glancing and staring for a few moments, enamoured by the novelty of double vision.  Don't back someone like Ana into a corner, not with a head that's a little twisted right now. She shakes her head tightly, and now says once again, clasping her hands hard to the point that her knuckles turn white. 'Baroness. No. Please... think of the priorities... we have two days...' Her descent begins. 'Please no. Any way you got this knowledge, you did not get it from me! You... you...' And further she descends, from fear to paranoia - the metaphorical fur starting to raise. She flings her hands at her sides, and now The Rage (tm) is starting to well up, though it's got a wyld chaotic fling about it, like a live wire dancing on wet pavement. 'I give you truth and you stab me in the back! And they call Eiluneds treacherous!' Suddenly, she looks at her hands she just flung and becomes /intensely/ interested in them, The Rage (tm) subsiding almost as quickly as it came. She drops her jaw a little and waves her hand in front of her face, then two and fro in front of her eyes. This most delighted little smile comes over her lips.   Eri looks between Pobble and Anastasia, her expression worried now. 'Um, Doctor, would you mind very much if I took the young lady home now? She looks like she needs to rest. And I hope next time we meet under better circumstances...' she sighs. Her hand reaches for Anastasia's upper arm, but gently.  Pobble moves to stand, looking uncomfortable and surreptitously slips something from a pocket into Anastasia's hand. He gives her a 'shh' look after glancing at Eri and straightens out his coat. 'Well, eh.. It was fabulous meeting you both. Again but different.' He stands sheepish, clapping his gloved hands together and smiling like the boy who's been caught doing something terribly bad but is unashamed. He nods to Eri's request. 'I think that may be wise..'  Anastasia points to Pobble, 'But what about him, wandering around, enchanted like that...?' She looks to Eri, a little hopefully. 'Pobble, come find me again. I'll be right here.' She taps the ground with her foot, and nods to Eri. 'Don't get me in trouble... or I'll be very upset.' There's a dark tone just beneath the surface on those last two words.          ",5534,1000,The Brewery Main Room(#1215RJMs A light murmur of voices often can be heard upon entrance to the pub everything from politics to the sports game shown on the television to the side of the bar Tables rest in a pattern that would only make sense to a designer cursed with insanity and hatred of servers There are several tables that line the wall in which the main door rests but as they come to the door they arc out onto the main floor and dissolve into a jumble of wooden chairs and formica tabletops Yet perhaps to aid those seeking certain tables each tabletop bears the image of a certain logo for a type of beer One can see a chubby weasel caught in mid-flight with the words Fat Weasel written underneath beside the more traditional logo of Budweiser This bit of kitsch is forgone though when it comes to the bar itself The bar is made of solid oak and polished until it holds a warm glow This glow is constantly sustained by the rag held in the hand of the harried soul tending to the drinks and woes of the patrons of this establishment The occasional waitress and more intrepid soul can be seen venturing near the strange cauldron forged of shining steel and stranger intent There is a spigot on the side from which those waitresses who dare its shining bulk draw its blood to serve to those of adventurous bent There is a door set in the back wall A door that bears a white sign which states that none may enter Still waitresses and the bartender can be seen making their way to the door and slipping beyond These journeys into the forbidden are brief but always do those who return from its hidden wonders bear a broad smile and a pair of mugs filled with liquid gold that go only to patrons who seem to bear friendship and/or kinship to the staff of this

172,172,1151815,1,25,"       Pool Hall - Back Room          The walls of this room were possibly once white, but are now stained nicotine yellow with yet dirtier splotches in places. The dark red carpet seems newer and less obnoxious than the one found in the main hall. Tall lamps stand in each corner of the room, shaded so they cast their light upwards giving the room a certain ambiance.          The central space is occupied by a trio of well used couches with newish slipcovers in dark shades - One green, one red, one blue. Arranged into a vague triangle, a low table sits between them with a black ashtray sat upon it. Against one wall is a stocked mini-bar sealed with a padlock and next to this a rack has been mounted on the wall containing poker chips and cards, similarly locked. The mood of the room is shot to peices by what sits squarely against the far wall opposite the door: The porcelain goddess. One shiny clean toilet with a wooden seat and lid, sitting next to a washbasin. A little way down towards the right corner hangs a payphone. A noticable thing is that it is overly quiet in here, perhaps the walls have been soundproofed as none of the sound from the adjacent hall carries over.  Obvious exits: Door [O]  You paged Quiet with 'Hey'. You paged Quiet with 'Listen, can I talk to the dead girl?'. [waiting... waiting... waiting...] Long distance to Quiet: Penny shakes you. From afar, Quiet is shaken. Wha? You paged Quiet with 'Dead girl.'. Quiet pages: Which dead girl. There are lots. You paged Quiet with 'I wanna talk to her. Can I talk to her? The one we were looking for. that one.'. Quiet pages: How did you wanna talk to her? From afar, Quiet shakes you. You paged Quiet with 'Hi, I'm back. Sorry. SO yeah - wanna contact her. Just a sec'. Quiet pages: Just gotta gimmie the how and I'll be glad to give it a try. :)   You paged Quiet with 'I want to summon her, if she's open to it (spirit 3/corr 1)'. Quiet pages: You don't need Spirit 3. Just spirit 2. May I join you? You paged Quiet with 'I knew that. Honest. Join away.'.  Quiet will be joining you in three seconds. Quiet has arrived.  OOC> Quiet says, 'I knew you did. Otherwise I'd have to take your magick license away. ;)' OOC> Quiet says, 'Go ahead and pose what it is you are doing.'  Penny has a bad photocopy of the girl. The girl in question. It's upside down on the table and she's trying to make it levitate, trying to make it stand up on edge and turn around to face her. Penny says to the photocopy 'Look, your parents .. /and/ your mentor were worried sick. We know you're over there so just come this way. Come over here and tell us who got you. We're all really sorry..'  OOC> Quiet says, 'Extended ritual?' OOC> Penny says, 'If you wouldn't mind. With a wp spend first?' OOC> Quiet says, 'I don't mind. How many rolls?' OOC> Penny says, '3 - one to get her attention, one to bring her across and one to send her back.' OOC> Quiet says, 'That would actually be two different effects. attention/bringing across would be one. Sending back would be another. How many rolls for the first effect?' OOC> Penny says, 'we get a reduced diff here in the sanctum, too so.. whatcha think - diff 5? // 2' OOC> Quiet says, 'werks for me' OOC> Penny says, 'Right on.'  [Ed Note: TOTALLY forgot I wasn't actually IN The sanctum, perhaps A Sanctum... props to Quiet?]  OOC> Quiet says, 'Bombs away. Fire off the dices.'  [Willpower] Penny spends a Willpower point.  Penny rolls 3 (3 dice) at a difficulty of 5:  5 8 5 Achieving 3 successes, resulting in a complete success.  Penny rolls 3 (3 dice) at a difficulty of 5:  10 4 8 Achieving 2 successes, resulting in a moderate success.  OOC> Penny dances! OOC> Quiet says, 'Woot! Very nice.' OOC> Quiet says, 'Go ahead. Make one more pose and then I'll come in.' The paper tilts up.  Even Penny's surprised - she's never attempted something so basic this sober. 'The thing is, if you were rubbed out by the same people we're semi/quasi hiding out from? We really need to know, so could you come talk to me?'  The paper tilts up and then it falls off the board. It flutters to the ground where it lays for a moment. Then it trembles and the girl's eyes blink. She gazes up at you. 'Who... who are you?' The soft, spectral voice seems to echo oddly from where the picture lies.  Penny pivots the chair and plants her feet on either side of the paper. She leans over, elbows to knees and says in her nicest, most convivial voice 'Aw sweets, I'm Penny. Your mentor sent us chasin'after you but you were way ahead of us, weren't you.'  'I... I can't be here.' She says softly. 'He'll know! And he'll find me.' The girl sounds fearful. The paper flutters and sweeps along the ground a few steps. As if she were trying to run. 'What... what do you want from me?'  'No one can find you if you come on out,' she coaxes and offers her hand 'Come on out. It's safe up here with me. Come on up and tell me who did this to you, that's all I want you to do - just come up here and talk to me.' Penny kicks the chair back and gets down on the floor where the paper is. 'I /can't/ leave. I'm bound... I can feel it.' The paper shivers again and then she says, 'What do you want?'  You say, 'Who bound you? Who put you there? WHO? Are you alone?' She's furious and kinda freaked out. Why won't she come out? Penny's actually breaking a sweat. 'Who put you there?'  'The dark one... the wax man.' The girl responds, her voice still has that hollow echo. 'There are so many here... hundreds.. I don't know for sure...' She sounds really scared, alone. 'I'm with the Frankenstein... he killed me.' Penny seethes, hands fisted 'And there's no way to get out? None at all? No door? No window? Hundreds?' Piecing in together, Penny shrieks 'He put you inside the figure? WHY? What is it making you do? Does...' and exactly what was she going to say. She's lost her ability to talk, just gaping at the talking piece of paper.  'We are all trapped here... we hear dark whispers from those who have been there from the beginning. That we shall be consumed... burned up. A ritual of some dark purpose... I don't know. But I'm so scared. Dying is one thing... but this means I will never...' Words trail off and the paper quivers a bit.  You say, 'Okay, okay. Don't.. I'm coming to get you.' Somewhat bravely, Penny declares this with a voice not entirely forceful 'Okay? I'm coming. We're coming and .. just .. don't tell anyone. Is there anything you /can/ do?'  'Nothing... there is one here... a little girl. Somehow she got free... but she stays behind. Because if he knows, he'll replace her.' The paper trembles again a moment. 'I'll see if she can find you... oh no... I hear him... he's coming...' The words trail off and she screams. And then the paper bursts in to flames.  Penny reaches to put out the flames - you never know what Pobble's left laying around. Or that fucking monkey. Who is cowering behind a chair to Penny's left. She takes it out on him 'Couldn't you be the least bit helpful Dave? You could've TOLD me. That fucking creep from the record store. And ENID, .. Daisy'll be so disappointed. Dave, get out here. You're on recon. Don't even START' when the Monkey starts to disappear 'you know what's going on here,' she points to a nebulous space between herself and Pobble's lab 'so don't even pretend like you're just working for him, okay?' Penny, she's hysterical.  Pobble opens the door and enters from the main room. Pobble has arrived.  Okay so like, this is how it is:  Penny's out of sight but her hat and jacket are draped across the back of that first couch. Get a little further into the room and there's Penny folded up in some medatative state. Nearby is a pile of ashes. Dave's still chittering in a corner some kind of crazy-sounding shit about Penny torturing spirits.  There is the sound of a key rattling in the lock, one.. two.. three. Click, clock, clack. The door creaks open, the motion coinciding with the exhalation of noxious smoke from the entering individual. Haloed in the barlight-through-drugsmoke haze, Pobble strolls into the back room with a bottle of beer in his non-smoke holding hand. He stops, peering across at David L with eyes that would be curious if they weren't struggling to focus through the haze of potent narcotics. 'Whots going on 'ere then?'  You say, 'Your monkey's got no balls.' A declarative.  Penny's eyelids flutter and her posture slackens. Her spine cleaves her to the couch and she hauls herself up with an elbow climbing into the cushion. 'Went a little astral to check it out. We have a little problem,' she goes on, not missing a beat 'the kid we're supposed to be returning to her Mentor is not-quite-dead and I don't really know if it's responsible to return her ghost to her Mentor or not! I mean.. if something had happened to me I know I'd want to be with you guys in whatever unfinished form. It totally beats an eternity of lonely wandering y'know? All pathetic and unresolved but impotent at the same time?'  'You what what?' Pobble wanders over and plonks himself down next to you on the couch. The motion causes him to expel another little burp of intoxicating fumage. Thin silver topped fingers proffer the black smokestick in your general area as he swigs from his bottle. 'That hermetic wench is dead but not forgotten? Where'd you find her?' Putting the bottle between his legs, Pobble extracts a small baggie of white powder from his pocket and throws it at Dave. Dave grabs it and burrows his way into one of the couches. There are sounds of sniffing.  'Mr. Dark put her in the Frankenstein statue..' indicating with pointed finger that she is not in fact having you off '..it's what she said. And there's hundreds more like her. And it's Mr. Dark's doing. Scared the shit out of me when I couldn't pull her through to me. But we have to get her.' It isn't nobility or anything like it, in Penny's voice has crept a familiar note; greed. 'We're getting paid to and should live up to expectation if not legend.' Penny unfolds her legs and pulls the bottle out from between Pobble's. She swigs 'So go find that map in Hiro's mess and we'll be on our way.'  'Ha ha.' exclaims the good Dr sucking down a hearty dose of narcotic bliss as a metaphorical pat on the back. 'So I was right. Crazy fucker Cornelius was up to no good the whole time. Can't fuckin' make a wax crowbar my ass.' He makes a little wave, 'Don't need a map, I knows where that place is well enough.' The far couch makes a snorting noise then chitters quietly. Pobble purses his lips, reacing forward to ash into the central cigarette-waste disposal container. 'Intrestin'.. Interestin interestin intrrestingg.' Repetition causes slurring. Steve lies back lolling head lazily against the back of the couch. Something registers and his noggin rolls to one side - your side - and he asks dazily 'You want to go now? Like.. right now right now?'  'No, I want to go when I've had time to think about how stupid it would be to steal a spirit from whatever jail it's stuck inside from really what amounts to an unknown enemy. Keene would kill me for thinking so no, I do not want to wait and /think/. I want to go right now, right now.' She was saying all this as she was getting off the floor, getting her jacket, picking up markers from the pen/cil jar. Penny's ready.  Pobble says, 'Joo yoo think he's a neffanzi?' The smoke between his lips waggles up and down spuriously as he queries. A hand lazily pats pockets, checking for supplies in the face of unexpected action. Drugs, check. Weaponry, check. Monkey under sofa snorting cocaine, check. Inclination to elevate one's position from couch, absent. Pobble closes his eyes for a moment, 'Not later later?'  You say, 'Now now, right fucking now. Get up, get that fucking monkey and let's get in the car and drive. I don't know shit about what he is but I want him to know we can't stand that kinda shit. Not a fucking minute of it.' She checks her own pockets; nothing but lint. 'Look I don't wanna kill the guy, I just want to get the kid so you got a gun or something? Just in case?'  The chemist nods, and seems to concentrate a moment. Dave saunters out from under the couch and moves to Pobble's side as he stands. The smoke is stubbed out and he stretches, yawning. 'Fine fine.. I just hope you know what you're doing since I have no fucking idea what's going on.' Moving towards you he wraps an arm about your shoulder, 'If this all goes town the shitter,' A solemn nod, 'It was good.' Dr Steve's face melts to one side, making it hard to choose in favour of these words being serious doubts as to the survival of the dastardly duo this evening.  [Ed Note: Then, speak of the devil... ] As Pobble steps out...  Keene comes in from the main hall. Keene has arrived.  Smells like something burning. Dark in here but not as dark as it could be.  So Pobble just stepped out for a smoke or maybe to find something to lock Penny in the office with. Either way he's not here and she's making notations in a glossy unfolded map of the Wax Museum. 'Ready?' manic, crazy look in her eyes 'Oh. Steve.' What she says, what she calls you when she's disappointed.  Keene comes in from the bar, spritzing his coat with a little Febreze bottle as he closes the door behind him. He looks over at Penny with his usual unreadable expression, continuing to spritz himself while making his own assessments of the situation.  'Hello, Penny. What are you up to?'  Penny says, 'See this is exactly what I was telling Ste' confused a minute '-Steve. .. STEVE!' So annoyed, she grabs the map up in a fist, not realizing. 'This is just what I said to him, I JUSt said it to him. He wanted to go later and not now and I knew YOU'D agree with him' accusing Keene of something clearly apparent to her 'I hate it when you gang up on me.' Like the pout could last long. 'The point is she's not quite dead and her Mentor's still paying, right? He didn't say she had to be in one piece, right?'  Long distance to Quiet: Penny is scening out some more of the preamble. You're welcome to watch. Quiet will be joining you in three seconds. Quiet has arrived.  'I was told,' Keene says, after a moment's consideration of Penny's incoherent rambling, 'that he wished to know what her disposition was. We had no power to prevent her death, since we were informed of this well after the fact. Or so I believe.'  Keene fishes a cigarette out of his pocket and rests it between his lips, digging in his pocket for a lighter. 'How dead is she, anyway?'  Penny says, 'So what, you think he was fishing for info she was actually more dead than alive? Like ..maybe he sent her off on purpose? I never even thought'a that.' Her fidgeting paused for a moment, she comes back to life pulling at her clothes - she knocked something over, a paper cup rolls and bumps into an arc on the floor. Inbetween wiping down the wet, Penny looks up at matches hanging off the edge of the table, indicating with a nod 'You got anything we can put her in? Like a spare Ronald or something? She got bound once so we can throw her in something til we get back to the loft... y'know, so we don't lose track of her.'  As always, what Keene chooses not to answer is more telling than what he actually decides to acknowledge. He walks over to the table, picks up a match, strikes it against something convenient and lights up. The cigarette soothes the turbulence within, at least for a while.  'Does it have to be particular?' asks Keene. 'A particular size, a particular shape, a particular color?'  'Nah, anything really' Penny seems sure of it but adds 'Bigger than a breadbox? Duffle sized? The thing is we gotta go now and get her and find out what he's doing with the other hundred or so he's got stashed there.' She's just about packed up and ready to go.  'Charming,' Keene says, completely deadpan. He puffs on his cigarette, turning to head towards the door. 'Off we go once again, to our imminent deaths. I'm going to make sure this is on my expense report. I probably have something in the car.'  OOC> Penny shakes Quiet OOC> Quiet wakes up. Eh? Wha? Ya need me for sumpin? OOC> Penny says, 'Yeah. We're leaving (with an invisible Pobble) for the Wax Museum.' OOC> Quiet says, 'Okay. My alter evil is there already.' OOC> Penny doesn't want to scene with him; unless he's somehow bugged the pool hall's office and knows who I am and why I'm coming. OOC> Quiet says, 'He's always there unless he's out for some reason. Whether or not you see him.' OOC> Quiet says, 'Cornelius lives there.' OOC> Penny says, 'right so. off we go, non-chalant to unbind a spirit.'  -= Jones and Greens =-          There is a mixture of various ethnicities and social backgrounds within this small area, a melting pot all come into one. The very businesses appear to take a culturally diverse avenue of theme. Many smaller stores here can be found selling foreign foods and other rarities such as special health items. Besides the consumable goods, other fine import stores are littered about as well, making this small area more interesting for those that enjoy window browsing.         The nickname of 'Tourist Lane' has been placed upon the area, proving that out-of-towners often stay at a small cluster of higher class hotels. Both those visiting for vacation as well as business reasons can be found in almost equal amounts. Small stands of maps, newspapers, and novelty items can be found down the lane to take advantage of those visiting the city.   Contents: Phineas Obvious exits: Dark Horizon DH  OOC> Penny lets Keene set.  Driving in a black luxury sedan -- an Infiniti of some variety -- Keene and Penny take a trip from the bad part of town to another bad part of town ... the tourist district. The vehicle rolls into a nearby parking garage, where it makes its way to a certain part of the structure that is statistically unlikely to be disturbed by most car thieves or homeless people.  Climbing out of the vehicle, Keene sets the car alarm and begins walking towards their destination. Across his shoulder is his messenger bag's strap, with the bag itself having weird dents in it from an over-large object within.  'This is an exceptionally poor idea, you know,' Keene says, deadpan.  Phineas has disconnected.  'Pobble thinks so, too. Don't worry.' Penny's a bit keyed up. Sugar-high of a variety unknown to even six-year-olds. She's putting on a pair of wire-rimmed glasses as they walk down the block toward the Wax Museum. The pair look strange among a vacationing crowd, 'I wouldn't do this with your approval anyway.' She chews the cap off a marker and tips it felt-side down in her back pocket. When it bleeds out, it'll just add to her urban hippy look.  'You realize,' Keene says, reaching into his coat, pulling out a hip flask, and taking a swig from it before holstering it once again, 'that you need me alive to collect on whatever boon he'll give us for this job.'  He puts his hands in his pocket, watching traffic idly as they grow nearer to the museum. 'Because I would rather not get Chased.'  'Shoulda parked closer.'  Penny's head is now in the game. Because when questioned, witnesses usually describe how the angry young person elbowed and shoulder their way through the crowd. So she throws her shoulders back and affects a pleasant, if not sunny, air. She takes a hold of Keene's hand, fellow tourist and tugs him as they close on the doors to the museum.   'Subtle,' Keene says, being tugged along. He keeps at least one hand on his bag throughout.           A very nice, plastoral looking building in the busier part of town. Recently rennovated, it has a pleasant facade to it, completely with a large hedge around the property, manicured lawn and topiaries of animals.  You enter the waxworks. The large double doors swing open for you. Dark Horizons Waxworks - Main Room(#1957RJ)          This room is not particularly large. Just an entrance room, really. Heavy black curtains hang over the windows in front, shutting out almost all of the ambient light from the world beyond. The room is lit only by real candles and gas lamps. The air carries an old, almost must scent to it, giving you the sense of walking in to a building centuries old, even though it is a relatively new rennovation.         The walls are mostly wood panelled but not in any particular order. Chaos seems to be theme of the decor. The ceilings are high. Ridiculously high seeming, as if they extended far beyond human vision, in to the pitch depths up above. Something may be lurking up there, even now. In several spots there shelves are set in to the wall. Each shelf is empty. The books themselves appear to be sunken in to the walls, giving the room an even odder feel. The floors are completely bare of any sort of coverings. Just finely polished stone. In the center of the main room is a series of ten chairs. The really nice kind, with deep seats and thick velvet cushions. There is a circular table in the middle of them with two books displayed.         Off to the left side is a smallish office. In the back center of the room, you can see a pair of doors, oaken. One door has the face of a smiling demon, a brightly polished brass nameplate under it says Fiction. One door has the face of an angry, almost leering demon, another brightly polished brass nameplate under this one says Fact. There are no visible handles, just a hole in each open mouth with tongues sticking out.                                 +views available                                  Contents: Cornelius Obvious exits: Fiction FI  Fact F  Out O Keene enters from the street. Keene has arrived.  OOC> Cornelius says, 'Please, pose entry. I will be Quiet's extension for scening until otherwise notified that the NPC Cornelius has shown himself.' OOC> Keene says, 'K.'  'Wow look at the doors,' she whispers, pretending awe. Convincing. And when she thinks no one's looking, Penny grins at the table and chairs, mutters something under her break to Keene and steers him toward the doors 'So which shall we check out first, fact or fiction?' Some kind of open-ended joke, they stare.  The museum is empty. Or so it seems. It's extremely quiet and the lights are extremely dim. It would seem that no one is home at the moment. Keene has a messenger bag over one shoulder that has weird bulges in it. It contains something larger than the bag really ought to contain. He acts the part of a tourist perfectly, having a true gift for deception. Everything from his eyes to his body language reads `sucker' rather than `terrorist'.  'Fiction sounds neat,' the suited man says.  Penny was headed that way anyway. But the word 'neat' coming from Keene is enough to stop her mid stride. Puts a bounce on it, heel to toe 'But Tommy I heard there was one of *the president* in Fact - can't we go there first?' She blocks the door and handle to the Fiction room; full-on - vamping it up horror-story-style. The door swings open and she leans backwards into the tilt. It even creaks.  Keene generates a put-upon expression as Penny whines at him, moving to intercept her. 'Jen-Jen,' he says, generating a cutesy name on the fly, 'if we go see the President now, it won't be as special as if we saw it last. Hey, be careful --'  He jerks forward into the Fiction room, as if to try to pre-empt her from a spill. Keep moving, Keene.  You enter the door marke Fiction. Dark Horizons Waxworks - Fiction          Welcome to the hall of Fiction. The hallway is filled with a series of scenic wax sculpture of infamous men, women and monsters from literary history. Each one of these is done up fantasically but with enough of a sense of reality in them to create an air of true menace. This hallway breathes life in to dark figures in fiction, the grand literary tradition of horror, both modern and gothic. Each scene seems to be worse than the last. The gore. The expressions of agony, of torment. It's a difficult thing to look at for long. Unless you like that sort of thing.         This hallway is fairly long, wrapping around to the side, probably heading back the way you came. The floors here are rough, unworked earth it would seem. The ceiling here is extremely high, invisible to the eye. Very dark up above. Occasionally you can hear a menacing sort of scrabbling noise in the rafters. As though something were following you as you move along the displays. From somewhere in the darkness, light fog trickles down. It leaves maybe a foot worth of cover on the ground, hard to penetrate.                                  +views available                                  Obvious exits: Out O  Cornelius enters from the main room. Cornelius has arrived. Keene enters from the main room. Keene has arrived.  Penny who is Jen-Jen (Jenny jenny who can I turn to?) makes a grab for Keene on his way past her, slips onward expecting the door to swing shut. Did it? The noise was absent and it's lack settles down into the pit of the stomach. She scuffs her boots down the hallway, commenting as she goes along 'Poor Lizzie, doesn't she always get a bum rap..'  The hall of Fiction is extremely quiet. Silent like the grave. Your voices echo strangely in this place. With it's foggy bottoms and large, open tops. Everything here feels... wrong. In a very subtle, difficult to define kind of a way. OOC> Penny says, 'awareness rolls?' OOC> Cornelius says, 'Yes. Awareness + Perc, diff 7 for the moment.'  Keene rolls perception+awareness vs 7 (3 dice) at a difficulty of 0:  8 4 10 Achieving 3 successes, resulting in a complete success.  Penny rolls perception+awareness (7 dice) at a difficulty of 7:  7 -1- 2 5 3 5 3 Achieving 0 successes, resulting in a failure  Keene grabs onto Penny, trying to keep her upright. Once they're through the door, though, he releases her and adjusts his messenger bag strap. 'Wow, this place is creepy,' he says, the master of understatement.  OOC> Penny says, 'You'd think MY odds were better.'  'Jeepers Freddie,' she elbows him and laughs in a pretty careless way 'You should hear yourself. I bet it's just the temperature change - all that dry ice in one place tends to get a little on the stale side a few hours in.' On the whole Penny's pretty blase. Or good at faking blase.  Penny's good. Keene is better. He laughs in that overly loud American way, making an exaggerated `spooky' face. 'But bad ventilation is spooooooky,' he says, like Count Chocula.  +view of Frankenstein's Monster: Dark, dreary gothic village setting mayhaps provide you with some sense of where this takes place. Several small vllage huts are in the background. A moon hangs high in the sky. Apparently some of the fog generators must be above this display because it is foggy also, excess spilling to the walkway. In the scene you can see Frankenstein's Monster in all of it's terror and pity provoking grandeur. It stands there, face weirdly illuminated by a greenish light. In it's arms is a small, broken body. A young girl with a wilted daisy still clutched in her right hand that hangs out loosely. Her eyes are glassy, lifeless. She seems to stare out at you, jaw broken and hanging. The monster itself has a mixed expression of horror at its actions and savage triumph.  'Come this way,' sounds cheerful and curious about what's around the next corner. Penny turns in toward the dark, gothic village setting. 'Now is that what they're paying to see?' She looks at the broken kid-statue, arms folded, head tilted - judging. She walks to it's side - not to get a closer look but maybeb to keep out of it's direct line of sight.  Keene, meanwhile, blunders forward and transposes himself between Penny and the statue -- reading her body language, knowing how this game works. He stares at something inconsequential off to the side of the statue, doing his best cow-eyed tourist impression. 'This reminds me of that movie, with the guy,' he says. Keene works for Clear Channel. He knows all about inane banter.  The display of the Frankenstein's monster seems almost brooding. The girl's vacant eyes quite oddly seem to follow Penny's movements. You don't see them move... but wherever she is standing, the eyes seem to be looking.  OOC> Penny says, 'I'd like to do another roll. Matter/Prime myself - raise my body temperature the better to melt the statue's two pair of eyes.' Cornelius pages: How do you mean, exactly? Not sure how that effect would work. You paged Cornelius with 'As a foci-related effect: Wax melts at 138 degrees so via foci: Penny can write 138 degrees on her hands with the magic marker and radiate body heat of that temperature, using prime she can hurry along the damage to whatever trap is keeping the girl's spirit lodged in the figure.'. Cornelius pages: Mmm. You would need a lot of successes for body heat alone to have that impact. Unless you were very close to the statue. Like, right next to it on the display. Long distance to Cornelius: Penny intends to put her hands on it. Cornelius pages: Okay... then pose the action first and then I'll call for rolls.  Concealed briefly, Penny backs up into Keene and casually writes all over the backs of her hands. The Sharpie stink is strong. New. 'Open the bag, just unzip it' Penny's turned Keene around to explain with brief gestures and in some other language what it is she intends to do. Melt the eyes, break the cage, catch the girl and run. Really fast.  Keene unzips the bag casually, making it look like he's looking for something. 'Shoot, I should get a picture of this for Leroy,' he says, but unzips the bag too far -- a box-shaped object falls out, sliding onto Penny's feet. It isn't very heavy. Meanwhile, various papers also fly out, causing Keene to chase after them and gather them up in his arms. 'God damn it!' he says, fumbling with the various sized press releases he gathered off the fax machine for this purpose. Nothing like a klutz to draw attention away from a peyote-soaked maniac.  You paged Cornelius with 'this is where I'd turn and hit the statue.'. Cornelius pages: As a formality, please do me a favor and pose stepping on to the platform to do this. Long distance to Cornelius: Penny didn't see a platform in a desc. You paged Cornelius with 'Did I miss it?'. Cornelius pages: I am sorry. It's nothing specifically statted. And unneeded really. Don't sweat it.  When Penny steps close to the display and she passes the area where that is the boundry of the scene, the air ripples slightly and she simply vanishes from sight.  Cornelius pages: When you step across the boundry, you feel a faint tingling of your skin. Then you find yourself standing in a forest at night. In the distance is a small gothic village where the lights are lit. The air is extremely chill and there is a breeze blowing. In the distance you hear the sounds of an animal.  Keene continues scrambling around, picking up papers around him. Something in the back of his mind warns him something is wrong -- and he turns, seeing (or rather, not seeing) Penny. He keeps picking up the papers, putting them all in the bag and zipping it back up. For a few moments, Keene considers the situation. What to do?  He decides to try something -- Keene picks up the box-shaped object he'd left on the floor (actually, a very small hamster cage, complete with wheel) and eases it past the threshhold of the boundary of the scene with his shoe, waiting to see if anything happens.  You paged Cornelius with 'You think I'd be able to tell if I just stepped into the spirit world? awareness roll?'. Cornelius pages: Without the roll you can tell you're inside of some kind of pocket spirit realm. Like a mini-realm, subject to whatever rules were established during its construction. it seems very real however. Cornelius has disconnected. Sorry, Quiet is not connected. No one to page. OOC> Penny says, '... great.'

175,175,1151815,1,25,"       Overdrives Alley - Main Bar(#6632RlJM)       This is the large, open main room of a rowdy biker bar. Near the entrance is a single bouncer who casually looks everyone over as they enter. On the far side of the room is a long, wooden bar with old, leather-covered bar stools in front of it. Behind the bar is a long mural of a naked woman, sprawled out on her side. The liquor selection here is fairly limited, but there's a wide selection of beers to choose from.      Around the room are wooden tables of varying sizes, surrounded by wooden bar chairs. Along the wall across from the bar are a few booths. In one corner, next to the bar, is a door marked 'Staff Only'. Opposite it, on the other side of the room, is a staircase leading up to a more private room. There are two old, battered pool tables to the right of the front door. They charge a loonie per play and have a limited selection of pool cues, none of which are in good condition. A juke-box sits next to a small dance floor that is rarely ever used for dancing.                               Places available                                                                NIGHTZONE                                        The street out front is visible through the only window in this room.  Contents: Akiko Tom Jesse Jake Amano Owen Luthor   Luthor finishes his final drink and stands, walking away from the bar. Luthor stands and leaves Long wooden bar.  Jesse looks back down the bar. 'So, is Cade okay?' As though he hadn't just said that thing about the strapon. Back to whatever passes for dignity and composure to him. He yawns, rubs his face, grins faintly as the pills find their way through the brain/blood barrier. 'Who was the guy?'  Owen merely sighs at the turmoil, apparently unmoved by the incident at the door. Looking both sullen and bored, he summons the barkeep to settle his bill. Apparently calling it a night, the large man rises from the bar...vacating a valuable seat in the over-crowded bar.   Amano's mental wince manifests in a half-swallowed yelp, spinning 'round to confront her. 'Hey! That's not fair!' Too little, to late... He backs off a few steps towards the bar. Akiko Hops back onto a seat and grabs her drink sipping it for a long moment before turning to view the bar scene and look to see if anything changed.  Jake looks at Jesse a bit, 'A few cuts, a few bruses... no idea who the guy was. the cops aren't saying anything on the matter. Except he apparently shot his own hand off. People today...'  Akiko Rolls her head in a streching manner looking extremly bored herself now as she looks about crossing her legs and letting the dangling leg bounce in time to music.  Tom continues to lean against the bar, not even looking up for 'shot his own hand off'; being a fair bit of a bore, actually, a really boring fellow. His jaw tenses... loosely untenses. He takes a break from looking thoughtful and intense - no doubt involved in formulating some kind of big creative breakthrough or whatever. But then again, maybe not. His eyes give him away: he can often be found brazenly gazing at Akiko, enjoying the view while he has it. In, you know, a purely... chaste. Anthropological-slash-artistic way. You know, like that. (pfft.)  Amano is all sulky and exausted after that random little oredeal, draping his arms upon the bar, laying his head there, and wondering over the freaks who rest nearby. He actually seems rather interested in the goings on, which is rather special of him. Rising from the bar, Owen makes his way through the rough crowd. Still, his size and foul demeanor grants him some personal space as he heads for the door. Brushing past the bouncer, he bids the man 'Good evening' and disappears into the moon-lit night beyond. Penny drinks long, listening to the conversation but really more intent on those biker chicks. She's busy. Busy keeping them at arm's length with the occassional dirty look and brow lift. As if to tell them it's better on that side of the bar. That's not what she's here for, a bar fight. Penny doesn't have time for anything as low as fisticuffs with people; least of all people with helmet hair (she must only take on the pretty people, she looks like the kind of girl that may have been paid to mudwrestle.) No, a fight isn't her scene. No, the height of drama was between her and a feather and now? 'Oi, freebie over here' a hand up wave-wave-waving backwards behind her at the bartender.  'Well, serves him right.' Jesse shakes his head, tossing his artfully bobbed hair, and lights a new cigarette. 'You think that Daddy Frank cat had anything to do with it?'  Luthor heads out to the street. Luthor has left.  Jake thinks for a bit then comments, 'Who's Daddy Frank?' Jesse shrugs again, returning to his slow, gloved scratching at the length of his arm. 'Dunno. His name came up in conversation a couple times. Thought he was the competition.'  Daisy comes in from the street. Daisy has arrived. Penny laughs, catching that 'What, you're saying there's only room in this town for one kinda cult head shop?' Penny uh uhs like she knows everything and Jesse's just being paranoid. And still she's waiting for this elusive free beer.  Jake thinks for a long time, 'I never heard about him... competition you say... there's a posibility.'  Akiko Is a bit of a regular here she spots penny having a spot of trouble . She takes a pull of her drink draining it before looking over at tom with a smirk she slowly wets her lips with a pink tounge gives him an air kiss and moves over to where penny is ' Hey back off sluts she's my girl got it? ' a few of them seem to want to say something but back off from the tiny girl for some reason.  'Well, I mean...' Jesse just being paranoid is a little like the ocean just being wet. 'Like, we were talking about him the last time I was in there. And, I mean, it's not his real name, obviously, so he's already got an alias, and plus Cadence said what he wasn't really a Bokor, but Voodoo says he'll work for paper. So he's some vreiboter houngan, and the whole martyr complex thing just seems a little too pat, you know what I mean?'  His attention, then, snaps to Akiko. He looks her down, then up, then down again.  'You. Bubblegum. Fuck thee off t'a nunn'ry. Past your bedtime, sweets.'  Amano arches a brow at their weird gossip, watching it all with sideway interest. When the freaky little lady with the unzipped pants saunters into the mix, he gapes openly. Woo. Crazy. He forces his mouth closed in a naughty grin and backs off to get a better, safer, view.  Jake nod and seems to think about what jesse said. Alot.  Tom read your description.  Daisy's all pomp and swagger, striding in long and straight, like a man. Aviator sunglasses are propped up amongst her bangs; a cigarette droops, angled, from the corner of her lips. High-fives are dispensed at random to assorted punks. Not a regular, but recognized.  Tom is leaning against the bar, his back to the room in general. A broad expanse of back exposed to numerous disenfranchised fringe types who no doubt would like to take a swing at any gentleman matching the description of 'The Man' - and Tom rather fits the bill nicely. Brave man. As Akiko, you know, tongue-wets and air-kisses, and et cetera, she has his full and complete attention. She carries it all the way over to Penny, where, in fact, his attention diverts. Because, he notes to himself, drinking the beer, while Penny looks different, much different, she is in fact, still who she is, and there is little denying... you know, who you are, especially when you know it - or seem to know it - as well as Penny. So, there she is, and there's Tom, sort of studying her, recognizing her instantly but still. Drawn to the sight of a familiar face by an the sight of unfamiliar flesh. God, verb as he is, as Buckminster Fuller identifies Him, does do his action in mysterious ways. Akiko Looks to jesse and flicks a finger at him ' Hey I didn't ask you besides I don't see you help her with the riftraft you balless dick ' she sighs ' Hey girl anybody else gives ya greif just say so I'll nail'em other then that have fun call me if you need help ' she then moves back to hop onto her seat.  Penny looks over at Jesse and down at the little asian chick. Literally - downward sloping of the nose, chin and maybe even adjusts her stance because it's one thing to look at him in heels and quite another to look at her - size differences being what they are.  The pitch of her voice changes entirely, turns out a different kind of molasses than the stickysweet lingering at the bottom of those glasses at the end of the night 'What he means to say is 'I'm with him'' tipping a nod at Jesse in a stern kind of voice, with a certain kind of educated laughter involved for those in the know '..y'know what I mean? You ah, have a nice night..' And her tongue follows with a kind of clicking, drags on a cigarette and makes some gesture in the air at Daisy-low-on-the-radar.  Jesse is on his feet the moment the word 'balless' clear Akiko's lips. Drawing himself to his full height. Rolling out of his seat and flowing upright to, well, loom. Menace, threat, and the certain presence of jailhouse violence in the angles of his stance as he stares down at Akiko, his head listing slowly first one way and then the other, as though his assessment of her might change, given the rotation of his neck.  'Stand up and say that again.'  Akiko Hops down from her seat and looks up at jesse her own blue eye's now ice ' Sure ' she looks up ' I said you didn't seem to be helping her with the other biker girls so I decided to do if for you ' she pauses ' Or perhaps it was the fact I said balles did i touch a nerve? ' .  Amano shrugs up his shoulders, baffled, his fingertips tap-taping on bartop like nervous spiders as he inches away and twist 'round to face them. Hell no, it ain't his place, He winces for the girl's sake, if she doesn't have the sense to do so herself.  Penny hangs back, huffing out another cloud of smoke saying 'Jesus he's really gonna blow a hole through somebody f'he don't get laid soon' under her breath. Or maybe to Daisy. Depends on a body's unique perspective. Penny could be talking to herself entirely. So she hangs, kicks a boot onto the bar rung and knocks out another cigarette from a nowhere pocket for the other chick. 'Smoke'em if y'got 'em..'  And what she's doing, really, is bracing herself for impact.  Jake just watches for now.  Daisy screws herself down into a seat beside Penny, elbows backed up against the bartop. Lit cigarette transitions from lips to hand and lights the other one, which queues up behind the mostly unsmoked first one.  'He still carryin' around that shiv?', she asks nonchalantly, tapping the aviator glasses down over her eyes. 'Fucker don't know that's a parole violation?'  Hiro comes in from the street. Hiro has arrived.  And so this is it: what the evening has been inexorably gliding towards. From the moment he stepped in, Jesse's had a vague foreknowledge that it would come to this, to his gloved hand flexing and adjusting its grip on the neck of a beer bottle, to his squint as he reassesses the space between himself and his fill-the-blanks-in target. The night's had barfight written on it since the beginning, had had the story of the first punch determined even since before Jesse rolled out of bed. His jaw clenches. He looks at the bottle, looks at Akiko, and frowns for a moment, lost in some private reverie. Then blinks.  'Oi, Piggy. Wotcha. You wanna get yer wick dipped? Gotta bluelight here.' Some people do not belong in biker bars.  Hiro, however, posesses a certain fuckered countenance: a indefinite bearing that indicates that -- even if he doesn't belong here -- he personally feels utterly at home anywhere substances which damage neurons are sold.  As such: Hiro, in technicolor dreamcoat, lounge-slumping against the bar alongside Jesse. He rubs his fingertips against the base of his nose; sniffs once, nostrils flaring, scrub with the back of his hand. 'Oi, whatsit Jesse J. What's this then?' Akiko Blinks ' What? do you speak English at all or ya dumb as well as balless ? ' she shakes her head looks at the bottle ' You need a bottle too ? big man arn't ya taking on a girl half your size and you need a weapon too , my my arn't we a standing example of macho might. ' She clicks her tounge stud on her teeth.  Jake finishes off his beer and puts down the empty glass. He rubs his face a bit and humms a little to himself.  'It's like Batman,' Daisy explains to either Penny or no one in particular. 'He got this idea beforehand that the fight's gonna go like this, that he's gonna kick some ass, and you can almost see the cue cards. Biff bam boom. Maybe he seen it in a dream, that's why he's gotta do this shit.'  She drags from one cigarette and then the other and exhales their intermingled smoke.  Jesse blinks again, looking back down to Akiko. 'You still here?' He bares his snaggletoothed grin again. 'Ain't your momma worried?' Jesse looks past her once more to Hiro and giggles. 'Shit, 'rho. You gotta help me, here. I think I'm gonna hit a girl.' Jake waves over to the bartender, 'Another beer.' And he moves a few seats down out of the way of the impending fight.  At the outbreak of what looks as though it may be violence - well, ok, it's got Tom's bourgeoise values all stirred up, and he's got his middle-class backbone up, which also makes his head dip right down at the suggestion of... a fight? That's what criminals do, isn't it? Well, anyway, it's not what Tom does, and -- more reasonably, with much less cowardice involved, Tom knows enough about crowds to know what fights do to them. It gets them, well, freed up from certain social inhibitions. It's why you so often see armies looting, raping, pillaging. You break one commandment, you might as well go for broke - and when one fight starts, you start to see wild eruptions of others. But Penny, no doubt either his guardian angel or maybe just looks settled - and so Tom doesn't go anywhere. Just yet. Tom finishes his Heineken - by prior arrangement, or happy accident, or perhaps the contrivance of the bartender on his behalf, another is brought to him, and promptly, as in just as he finishes his old one. Oh, kind fate! Happy fortune! Tom sips the new Heineken (perhaps his last) in his civilized fashion, and when he isn't sipping beer, he's got his mouth set into this purposeful, determined line. And, you know, he's sort of occasionally still checking out Akiko's unzipped pants, the tattoo around her tits, the whole thing. //.etro: Petruchio will be joining your location.  Penny mutters to Daisy, '... no... looking,... does... in... direction. That... gesture... passingly... the... a... comraderie... them.... cigarette... lips,... the... stressing to her... impolite and obvious... you slice... down... smoke,... connection... and... starts to... she... motherfucker...'  When no one's looking, Penny does that sidelong thing in Tom's direction. That incredible and timeless gesture of the demimonde. It involves passingly good lighting, the tip of a bottle in a gesture of comraderie and eyelashes. Great huge sweeps of them. Her cigarette burns between her lips, an extension of the words 'We're /here/, Daze' stressing to her but talking to Tom's stare, impolite and obvious 'it's a violation any way you slice it.' Quick fingers draw down the smoke, ashes, re-establishes connection once again. There and there. Penny starts to nod at Tom as she puts a hand on Daisy's arm 'So if he's Batman, who's that cool motherfucker over there.'  'Why hit her when you can hit that,' Hiro mumbles, coming up with a cheap GPC -- once, twice, thrice through the fingers, turning end over end -- and wedging it into one corner of his mouth. The cigarette vibrates at a low hum; pig-boy slaps at the bar for a book of matches, and brings them up for examination. His head tilts to one side; he stares at the little paper sticks. 'She looks like a slip'n slide. You got a light, man?' Amano licks his lips and pushes away from the bar, weaving backwards among the tables until the back of a chair japs into his spine, and he takes the hint, takes a seat, and minds his business while he... browses.  And on down the line goes the cigarette, Daisy's second cigarette, to Hiro. It slips between the Asian kid's fingers without a word, and she turns back to Penny, chevrons of concern having already formed across her brow.  'And shit,' she says, perhaps too loudly. 'I ain't seen one of them since we left San Fran. Never shoot an honest cop, though, that's what I say.  Akiko Shrugs ' Swing or get out of my face but youw anna fight me show some back bone and fight with your fists not with some weapon ' she spits to the side ' Use a wepon I got nothing wrong with sending you to the hospital other wise this is a bit fo friendly sport I don't mind educating a Gaijin every once and a while '.  Jesse reels faintly, rolling his neck back as though with the force of Akiko's words. His brow furrows, his lips twitching as they sound Akiko's speech out, repeating it to himself, as his shoulders rise and fall, nodding with the rhythm of the phrases. Then he grins, and shakes his head no.  'Nope. This is the part where you go home. And I get drunk.' He giggles again. 'I had the wrong movie for a sec there. Are you sure you're not up past your bedtime?'  The borrowed cherry dips, rises in the smoky atmosphere; Hiro cups a hand around the tip of his smoke, puffing to ignite via the coal. Then, the cigarette goes to his lips; travels to the same corner as it's twin, and both tilt upwards as he inhales. 'Don't be so grouchy baby,' he advises. He doesn't even look over; he's staring silently across the bar; as if he were struck with a vision. 'You're clearly too sober f'r this kinda shindig. Clearly in need.' The bouncers slowly come walking over to the altercation in progress. Akiko Snorts ' Just as I though balless and dickless ' she shakes her head and turns towards the bar ' Go away you obviously don't have what it takes gaijin .' she motions for a drink from the bartender.  You paged Petruchio with 'PHENOMENON: With something as simple as the right look at the right time, Penny can lower her target's confidence completely. It's schoolyard rules. Don't mess with the cool kids. (Mind 2) ACTION: She'll come off the bar about a step and get the look in over Jesse's shoulder, briefly, to unnerve the target. Just to check and see he's got things under control and casually move back toward the bar. THEORY: Acting as backup for people (not like bouncers or security but like solid friends with certain knowledge that doom lives in their fists) it is entirely possible to make them look better/more fearsome than they actually are.'  Petruchio pages: Ok... t#5, roll to me. //.etro: Penny rolls 'arete' privately to Petruchio at diff 5.          For a total of 3 success(es) including 1 ten(s).  Petruchio pages: Is she nervious about you or about Jesse? You paged Petruchio with 'Jesse. Should he hit her, she'll have a really hard time getting up the nerve to a) get back up and b) hit him (raised diffs by +1 or number of succs? your call totally)'.  'I...' Jesse looks confused. He rubs his face, pinching his nose under his glasses. He takes a deep breath, and tries again. Nothing. He shakes his head. Looks to Hiro for support. I mean, you tell me. Guy standing, bottle in his hand, debating whether or not to break it on the side of some girl's head and she's walking away from him. She's walking away. But she's still talking. Jesse's flummoxed. This isn't the way it works. Something's gone very wrong.  If there is a bottle on the bar in Act One, it must be used on the girl with tape on her nipples by the end of Act Two. This violation of fundamental dramatic rules seems to vex Daisy: you can see the bloodlust seep out of her expression, and her interest return to the bar.   A flick of her fingers summons beer to her side. The bar's bad; the bartender's considerably better.  Igg and Ook, the bouncers, look from one person to the other and say in their best shakespearian terms, 'I'd der a problem?'  Jesse is pointing after Akiko and gaping, no comprehensible sound escaping his lips.  Hiro exchanges a wordless shrug with Jesse. 'You fucked it up,' he offers, mildly. 'And it won't work -- that's the wrong kind of liqour, and her hair's the wrong color. Not to mention the bar name isn't even a meaningful anagram. Give it up.' Upwards look; ironically or hopefully or seriously or balefully - he flashes a peace sign. Penny looks both ways across the bar, at the bouncers. They see this sort of thing day in, day out - nothing new to them. It'll probably sort itself out. She kinda smiles at one and looks over Jesse's shoulder at Akiko. It's a look not often seen on her face, one so grim and self-assured. Determined. 'Go on, JT' chiming accelerated taunts through the bottle. She doesn't touch him - that would be stupid, clearly - but lets the springs inside him tighten, moves back toward the bar.  Akiko Snorts and and hops off her stool walking for the exit ' Fuck this place and this shit, no problem I was talking to nothing. ' she complete ignores jesse he's beyond her notice now as she saunters towards the door.  Jake puts down his empty mug and heads out himself.  A chemical tang hangs in the air: one of Hiro's cigarettes is giving off a strange aroma, and he doesn't seem to notice. Both get plucked from his mouth in unison; he leans forward to go into assvision mode as Akiko strides off towards the exit.  Let's be honest: Tom is not at all concerned. This is how things operate in the realm of the rational. One guy pisses off one girl, harsh words are exchanged, someone almost gets hit in the mouth with a bottle, and fuck it, it all resolves itself, you know? No one gets hit in the mouth, no one bleeds out, no one dies. Especially not Tom. So Tom relaxes. Tom drinks his beer. Tom looks like a real load got taken off, like his shoulders are no longer stooped under the burden of extremely imminent violence done to his person. Tom lets his own spring come un-sprung, whatever pressing business he was deep in the contemplation of, completely the furthest thing from his mind, such as it is. He fetches a discreet little black box from the pocket of his coat and flips it open. Lifts out a tiny blue pill and discreetly swallows it with a gulp of beer. Before you can say 'the synergistic effect of alcohol with mind-altering psychotropic narcotics', he's got the pill box safe away in his jacket in the midst of all this chaos, and good for him, by god.  Jake slips through the crowd and heads out. Jake heads out to the street. Jake has left.  Amano shrinks down and slinks out of his seat, and since the bouncer's concern has drifted off elsewhere, he hopes his exit will warrent less attention than his enterance.  Amano heads out to the street. Amano has left. Sacha comes in from the street. Sacha has arrived. Akiko heads out to the street. Akiko has left.  Jesse slumps back onto his barstool, the narrative thread of his evening lost. He blinks sleepily and bares a wide yawn, propping his head up on one hand. 'Huh.'  Nonchalantly, Penny observes of the door hitting Akiko's ass on the way out 'Well that was ..fun.' A puss a sour turn, a drop in the corner of her mouth where there was the curbed mark of a grin just a moment ago. To her collegues she sighs, flicks a butt off to the side and gestures for another 'What the fuck are we /doing/ here?'  In the pocket, an open plastic bag. In the open plastic bag, an anonymous powder. Thumb goes in pocket, thumbnail (a rather unorthodox cokenail, but the only one she can't maneuver to bite down effectively) comes out with a loose payload of upper, and goes to Daisy's nose. She inhales sharply.   Entire maneuver takes, what, four seconds? Entire maneuver's hard to detect, but a sudden rush of induced paranoia causes her to turn back around and pay especial attention to the beer sitting in front of her.  'This place's a buzzkill,' agrees Hiro, freeing himself from the counter's gravitational pull with a carefully placed elbow. 'I'm gonna go watch the golden girls.' With that, Hiro begins to totter off towards the door.  Sacha walks in. It's been a loong time since he's been seen around here. Not since almost getting into another fight with some random person over shit and other shit. The tattooed man heads towards the bar nodding to the bartender looking for familiar faces.  Hiro heads out to the street. Hiro has left.  Yeah. Well. Whatever Tom was here for, well, either he got it (free beer) or it's gone (certain intangible sense of promise - the whole night lie out in front of him, like, to rudely paraphrase, some patient etherized upon a table)... and so, finishing his second beer, feeling the effects of the pill begin to radiate out, feeling a certain clarity of thought, a lack of distortion, an increase in mental fidelity... he's leaving crisp dollar bills on the bar, he's making sure he didn't leave his cell-phone out on the bar, he's performing, yup, all the stuff you generally do before you split.  Penny ohs! like there was something extremely important that was supposed to happen much, much earlier in the evening. 'Daze, listen hold up wait, wait' tugging the girl back over to a table near the front. Or whatever. In between biker and bouncer glares, Penny reaches into the deep trench-coat-pocket and pulls out a folded newspaper clipping 'We should definitely do this.'  The flush that passes over Daisy's cheeks lights her acne scars in sharp relief, even underneath the too-much-makeup. The posture changes too: from shoulders-forward punk swagger to an aw-shucks slouch, eyes averted and expression pointedly unreadable.  'I ain't what you'd call prime material for that,' she says, 'on account of they'd have to do some pretty serious work on my scars.'  From the hand that crosses over to rub at the opposite forearm, it's apparent that it's not just the acne.  And that's that, isn't it? Affairs settled, et cetera, Tom makes for the door. Without objection, it should be noted - the bikers are as gracious letting him out as they were letting him in - that is to say, he has a sore spot on the /other/ side of his ribs, a pleasant little symmetry to contemplate as he eases out into the night and gratefully makes his way home. Penny snatches the paper back from Daisy, just looks at her and says in the most obvious tone 'We totally need the money. And I'm not going by myself. Fuck that, my luck I'd get raped and murdered. And I'm *so* not bringing Piggy. He'd ..' well whatever it is she says, it's funny and clever and totally girl-talk-private. 'Please come? You don't have to like.. do anything. Picture you're an agent,' guiding Daisy out the door on the heels of Tom.  Once that's out of the picture, the swagger comes back, and Daisy's inscrutable expression stabilizes, finally, into a scowl. 'Yeah. Picture I'm seventeen feet tall and made of gold, 'cause that's way more believable.'  Rose White walks in, smiles, and heads over to the bar. Rose White sits down at Long wooden bar.  Tom tries not to let the door hit him on the ass, on his way out. Tom heads out to the street. Tom has left. Penny links arms with Daisy because they are going home together. Not 'together' but ..together. Charging out the door. So long, farewell, Auf wiedersehn, good night.  'Good. Because it's on my list of things to do before I die.'            ",5333,1000,Overdrives Alley Main Bar(#6632RlJM This is the large open main room of a rowdy biker bar Near the entrance is a single bouncer who casually looks everyone over as they enter On the far side of the room is a long wooden bar with old leather-covered bar stools in front of it Behind the bar is a long mural of a naked woman sprawled out on her side The liquor selection here is fairly limited but there's a wide selection of beers to choose from Around the room are wooden tables of varying sizes surrounded by wooden bar chairs Along the wall across from the bar are a few booths In one corner next to the bar is a door marked Staff Only Opposite it on the other side of the room is a staircase leading up to a more private room There are two old battered pool tables to the right of the front door They charge a loonie per play and have a limited selection of pool cues none of which are in good condition A juke-box sits next to a small dance floor that is rarely ever used for dancing Places available NIGHTZONE The street out front is visible through the only window in this room Contents Akiko Tom Jesse Jake Amano Owen Luthor Luthor finishes his final drink and stands

dignity and composure to him He yawns rubs his face grins faintly as the pills find their way through the brain/blood barrier Who was the guy Owen merely sighs at the turmoil apparently unmoved by the incident at the door Looking both sullen and bored he summons the barkeep to settle his bill Apparently calling it a night the large man rises from the bar...vacating a valuable seat in the over-crowded bar Amano's mental wince manifests in a half-swallowed yelp spinning round to confront her Hey That's not fair Too little to late He backs off a few steps towards the bar Akiko Hops back onto a seat and grabs her drink sipping it for a long moment before turning to view the bar scene and look to see if anything changed Jake looks at Jesse a bit A few cuts a few bruses no idea who the guy was the cops aren't saying anything on the matter Except he apparently shot his own hand off People today Akiko Rolls her head in a streching manner looking extremly bored herself now as she looks about crossing her legs and letting the dangling leg bounce in time to music Tom continues to lean against the bar not even looking up for shot his own hand off being a fair bit of a bore actually a really boring fellow His jaw tenses loosely untenses He takes a break from looking thoughtful and intense no doubt involved in formulating some kind of big creative breakthrough or whatever But then again maybe not His eyes give him away he can often be found brazenly gazing at Akiko enjoying the view while he has it In you know a purely chaste Anthropological-slash-artistic way You know like that pfft Amano is all sulky and exausted after that random little oredeal draping his arms upon the bar laying his head there and wondering over the freaks who rest nearby He actually seems rather interested in the goings on which is rather special of him Rising from the bar Owen makes his way through the rough crowd Still his size and foul demeanor grants him some personal space as he heads for the door Brushing past the bouncer he bids the man Good evening and disappears into the moon-lit night beyond Penny drinks long listening to the conversation but really more intent on those biker chicks She's busy Busy keeping them at arm's length with the occassional dirty look and brow lift As if to tell them it's better on that side of the bar That's not what she's here for a bar fight Penny doesn't have time for anything as low as fisticuffs with people least of all people with helmet hair she must only take on the pretty people she looks like the kind of girl that may have been paid to mudwrestle No a fight isn't her scene No the height of drama was between her and a feather and now Oi freebie over here a hand up wave-wave-waving backwards behind her at the bartender Well

176,176,1151815,1,25,"       **Penny and Compton do some more research in to happenings at Hyperion**  U of T - Courtyard(#532RJ)       The large circular driveway which circles the U of T courtyard appears as if it has been recently paved. In the daytime, close to a hundred student cars line the sides of the roadway, silent under the the slender trees. Students of every colour and ethnic background wander back and forth to their classes or sit, smoking, on the steps of the Sanford Fleming Building. Just to the north, a large circular expanse of grass turns the courtyard into a cul-de-sac. On the other side of the field the great dome of Convocation Hall dwarfs the surrounding brownstone buildings. Just to your left you see University College Residence, a large square featureless building. Utilitarian grey paint covers the outside of this institutional looking building, the only visible decorations being a number of posters and signs taped to the inside of their dorm windows. Facing this bland building, is one of the oldest buildings on the U of T Campus, the Sir Sanford Fleming building. The old brownstone building seems to have been recently renovated, and a bright blue sign on the small patch of grass in front of it confirms this fact. At night the campus is all but deserted, yet brightly illuminated with security lights. Haggard looking students wander the campus, looking as if they've just escaped the Siberian salt mines, some of them acknowledging the security guards who go about their rounds.  Contents: Dunce Campus Courtyard Bulliten Board  Penny picks up her cellular phone and begins to dial.  Dunce sits on the library stairs, reading.  Penny holds something small out in front of her. Looks like a phone. She stares at it, squints at it like it's supposed to be doing something. But clearly it isn't.  Compton from the other end of the line grumbles a vauge hello.  Penny stands neaby the bulletin boards, moves slowly to lean on one of it's posts and puts the phone to her ear again. She sticks her other hand in her pocket and juts that hip out from the wall; balance of a kind rocking heel-to-toe as she talks.  The room, despite basic descriptions is a bloody mess. 4 to 5 people have shared this space for a while now. There's a large hole burned in the carpet between the beds. Compton is sitting on the edge of the far bed talking on the phone, cradling his head in his hands, from the reciver can be heard Penny's shrill voice which seems to visibly hurt Compton, it says 'Yeah so I think I've got something here. Need to you to look at it, maybe make some changes. You hear about that accident the other night?', to which Compton grumbles a dull, 'Uh, no... big fucking city ya know?' in return.  Downtown - Spadina and Dundas W(#263RJ) Penny's voice on the phone is overly-loud. She volleys with 'Would you FUCKING WAKE UP. Jesus. Fucking motor oil for brains. And get Keene. He should see, too. Look,' she pauses, sounds like she's walking down a busy street. A jangle of noises; street vendors and hissing steam, busses and people. Must be Chinatown. 'I'm coming back now, okay? Plastered the campus with flyers again - should be a better turn out than last week. Get dressed. And you better not be in my robe. That shit's new.'  Downtown - Spadina and Queen W(#261RJ) Compton jerks the phone away from his stricken head, and listens to the rest of Penny's diatribe with the phone on his lap. He looks down and realizes that he is in fact not in Penny's robe, but in last nights clothes still. Next Compton peers at the detrius of the room around him, and eventually calls to the can, 'Keene? You there?' to no reply. Raising the receiver cautiously to his head he says, 'Keene's not here. I think.'  She sneezes and curses and yells 'Hey, I'm WALKIN'here!' away from the phone - it's muffled and covered in wind-noises. She must be pointing the phone at whoever just tried to run her over. Suddenly all background noise is cut off; like she stepped inside a vacuum. 'Comp? You still there? I'm here. Open the door, forgot my key again.'   Penny knocks on the door marked .  Compton hangs up the phone without another word. Gets up and crosses the room to the door, twists the knob and lets it swing oipen on his way tot he bathroom next to it. IN there the sound of a steady and heavy steam hitting the bowl resonanates for a couple of minutes. Finished witha lough moan/sigh of relife. You enter the apartment.  Room174(#4497ed)       To the right of the entrance is a modest bathroom that is sparkling clean. This room has two queen-sized beds separated by a few feet, with plenty of blankets and large fluffy pillows. Inside the second drawer of the nightstand that sits between the beds is a copy of Gideon's Bible. Across from the nightstand on the far wall is a TV that offers hours of cable entertainment. A note near the TV remote reminds you that pay-per-view adult movies will be added to your bill.      There is a window that overlooks the parking lot on the far side, next to a table with two chairs. Behind the table is the room environmental unit built into the wall, giving you control of the heat and air conditioning.                                                   Obvious Exits: Out    Contents: Escalus Compton Dave the Monkey % Activity in world legacy 'So, whatchew got for me.' come from the Bathroom which Compton occupies at the moment.   Escalus says 'Guys, I have ten minutes until lunch.'   Escalus says 'I will be back, afterwards.'  Penny looks down both ways before walking in the way people do when they know there's a boobytrap waiting to be sprung on them. Or not. She continues cautiously, still looking around the room. There's Keene's laptop. There's Jesse's sleepingbag. There's Pobble's box. 'Where's that goddamn monkey? He *better* still be bound and gagged.' Sneaks a look among Jesse's crates of lps. 'In that closet,' pokes through Hiro's amps 'Locked in the box,' insinuating she'll try to kill him again, Penny shuffles toward the second bed, shrugging out of her jacket.  'Comp?' knowing he's tuned her out for the better part of the rant 'Daze said she's bringin'home dinner later. Come out, wanna show you.'  OOC Compton says 'No worries. Sorry for the wait.' OOC Penny says 'We can keep ourselves occupied - how long'll you be? - so we can tailor our rp,..' OOC Escalus says 'I will be back 1 hour and ten minutes from now. But I am enjoying the scene.'  The gutteral glug-glug of the toilet flushing heralds Comptons return to the other part of Thi Invisible College's palace. He's looking alright actually, everything considered seeing how he has most likel;y just come off a bender with various heavy metals. His fly still down though, so at least there's a sense of inoperability still around. 'McRaunchy's again? Fuck, stuff gives me the shits.' is his opening comment. Nice.  Stretched out on the bed, Penny's skin is still slick from the fog outside. She looks strange; pale slithery thing, hollow eyed and bone shallow. Sunk low, she unpockets her phone and tosses it to the floor. 'My turn, right? Throw us a towel.' Rolling that way, she pulls open the drawer and clips herself a tab. 'Thought maybe I was seeing things, big crash outside the quay' tongues the square off her thumb 'go into my pocket and look at that. Guy totally flipped out and ran some people over..'  And afterward, looking at the ceiling 'Xyz, man.' Compton glances at the ceiling with you, looking for the Zee'sis for a moment before clueing in and closing the barn door. Grabbing any old towel from the end of the other bed he drops it on you when he plunks down next to you on the bed. 'Kay. Sounds pretty heavy.'  'Was,' affirming that 'Looked over and They said it wasn't nothin' they could sense so I kinda kept on but y'know that feeling?' She wipes the towel over her head, face and neck 'That one where you know something just isn't right.. had this intuition. So' she hitches back onto an elbow 'took that picture. Lookit,' nodding to the polaroid coming out of her jacket's inner-pocket.  Compton grins at the sight of the 'Polaroid' before even looking at the picture, 'Picking up soem tricks of the old guy eh?' he asks in usual Canadian parlance. Then he looksd at the photo and sees...? It looks likee a regular old car accident. Busted up vehicle in a lightpole, inured people on the sidewalk, unconcious driver, blood everywhere. General mayhem.  She smiles some, going gently into her altered state 'Shoulda SEEN this woman,' exaggerating details in drawn-out words 'Biiiig frilly dress comin'out of the Eaton Center. Totally into letting me borrow her stuff. Didn't have any'a your equipment, can't do that shit with the lights but maybe you can poke at it with your sticks, make it show us something.'  'Somthing?' Compton asks skeptically, and scowells at the photo as if willing it to just give up to goods and save him the hassell. 'Will take a while.' he adds defending his technical skills with a expectation buffer. 'What are we looking for?'  Her vaguest response yet, looking at the ceiling, the smoke detector. 'Something in the air.' Penny shifts herself a little and sneezes the other way. ''mind me to get a damn hat. Fucken weather.' She grouses and grumbles, then settles back down. 'We could sell'em,' indicating the pile of polaroids 'Or copies at least. Tabloids love this shit.'  Compton continues to glare at the 4x4 picture as he gets up and moves over to the heap in the closet and begins to rummage, pulling out a duffle bag.  Escalus has connected. From the bag, Compton pulls his rusty-trusty Ether Goggles. Returning to Keene's desk he sits down and dons them, using the erstwhile leaders Notebook as a spot to work on. Penny loses all interest in keeping her eyes open, starts humming something to herself. Indistinct at first, the tune builds into something recognizable. Flight of the Bumble Bee. It goes on like this for ten minutes; every other stanza interrupted by a sneeze or a cough. Finally she gets up and blows her nose with the last tissue in the box. She notices. She's subtle.  'You need to cut that out.'  'You don't have to do it now. Got something else in mind.' Clearing her sinuses, Penny grabs a marker on the way into the bathroom. OOC Penny says 'Hi :) Welcome back.'  Compton props the goggles up on his forehead and scowels at Penny, fucking flake that she is. 'What you on today woman?' he asks with mounting annoyance.  From the bathroom, Penny's disembodied voice echos 'Wednesday.'  Curt and to the point, that's all she says, all she needs to say. Some noises follow; clearing space, knocking empties into the garbage can, toothbrushes and hairbrushes and combs clicking with their plasticky static into the bathroom sink. 'Eep'ose og. Oo igh'eed'en.' Something impeding real annunciation. Marker in her mouth.  Compton pockets the Polaroid, and gets up witha grunt of effort from the all too small chair for his big ass and trundles off to the loo to see what Penny's up to this time. 'Huh?' is his response to your ooglings. The googles still on his mellon regardless.  OOC Penny says 'You with us Esc?' OOC> Escalus says 'Indeed, yes.' OOC> Penny says 'Kay, this is where my speshul talents come in.' OOC> Escalus is waiting with baited breath. OOC Compton waits with fish. OOC Penny says 'PHENOMENON - When Compton comes into the bathroom, Penny is going to close the door behind him. She has markered up the doorframe with the vacant lot's address. This is the door's new 'target' - it opens into the lot instead of Room 174. ACTION - Penny is using the doorway focus for the Corr/Matter effect to take place. THEORY - This was one of the last trick Penny turned to graduate from Benny's tutelage - a doorway is just another frame - another window out into the world. Turning the knobs and hinges out of a door is easy - they tell the door where you want it to open - it's all in the wrist.' OOC> Penny corrects: it opens into the lot's umbral representation. OOC> Escalus says 'Oooh. You do realize, however, that you do not have the spirit necessary to handle material. Compton does, however. You can sense across the barrier with spirit 1, but not move across it.' OOC> Penny says 'Right. Which is why he's in here with me. Ethernaut.' OOC> Compton bristles with helpfulness. OOC> Escalus says 'Allright, with you working together, Penny, you can add 1 auto success to each roll that Compton makes. This will be a difficulty 6 arete roll. Would you like to spend quint or willpower, and will you make it an extended roll?' OOC> Penny says 'Yes.' OOC> Compton does too, to be helpful, and because he never rolls well. :P OOC> Escalus says 'Penny, you are not actually rolling, so you cannot spend WP. Sorry.' OOC> Penny says 'Rats!' OOC> Escalus says 'Okay, Compton, you have two auto successes. Roll vs. diff. 6.' //.etro: Compton rolls 'arete' at diff 6          For a total of 0 success(es). OOC> Escalus says 'You have two successes.' OOC> Compton gets down to biz now. Sorry. OOC> Escalus says 'You can draw, with that, some spirit stuff into this room.' //.etro: Escalus rolls '6' at diff 8          For a botch! Compton lowers the goggles over his eyes as he realizes what Penny is up to by the glyphics she's scrawled around the door. Standing firmly in front of the prepared portal he opens the door and gazes beyond.  Flick of the wrist, Penny opens the door. Only it's no longer the sty of the Holiday Inn. Instead it's perennial twilight out there in the OtherSpace. 'Okay, now don't go too far. There's something out there - looks like brick only not. Get it, bring it back.'  OOC> Escalus says 'Where did you get the idea that they woudl be bricks?' OOC> Penny says 'Makin'it up.' OOC> Escalus says ''Kay! :D' OOC> Penny :)  Penny is totally unconvincing - she doesn't sound like she knows what she's talking about but she's into it. She's enthusiastic. She's psyched it worked.  So what're we looking at - what do we see?  'Penny. Go in to the bag (the one he brought in with him, that everyone hadn't noticed until now), and pass me the gloves.' Compton instructs quickly.  The brick sits quiescent in the umbra, since both of you can see it.  The gloves in question being an old pair of hockey gloves, that have several meters of sterio wire wrapped around the fingers and wrists, where they meet a couple of 9V batteries duct taped around the KOHO logos at the arm band.  Penny yanks them out of the sack, nose turned up 'You gotta dead rat in there? Shit man, supposed to air this stuff out before you put it away. Here..' hands them over without another comment.  The block is still unmoving. Just spirit matter floating where you put it.  Compton reaches back, and picks at the seat of his pants, adjusting a wedgie apparently, before taking the gloves and putting the two of them on. The first one goes on easy, the second one not-so as he had to negotiate it with the other glove. The he steps forward and reaches in to Otherspace with both hands, as if plucking a loaf from the oven.  Compton reaches back, and picks at the seat of his pants, adjusting a wedgie apparently, before taking the gloves and putting the two of them on. The first one goes on easy, the second one not-so as he had to negotiate it with the other glove. The he steps forward and reaches in to Otherspace with both hands, as if plucking a loaf from the oven.  The spirit-stuff is soft and spongy to the touch, just as you expect it would be.  Penny waits there like a kid looking for cookies. 'Hurry up with that. Don't want anything sneakin'.. ' Penny on the lookout. She's watching everything. 'Come on already.'  Compton steps back now, in his gloved hands the etherical tofu cube.  Penny tilts her head, staring. She slams the door fast and starts scrubbing at the writing on the frame with a toothbrush. Toothpaste smell festers in the air; minty fresh.  Compton stands there, blast goggles still on and his industiral oven mits and says, 'Um, where d'ya want it?' and turns to put 'it' down on the edge of the tub, to those not seeing in to the other realm, it just looks as if he'd doing some weird-ass mime routine.  You say, 'What's it feel like?' She scrubs harder, moving the ink, destroying the link. 'In there, in there. Put it there,' looking over her shoulder at the tub. 'Is it alive?'  Alive? That is an interesting question. As Penny destroys the link you can take the stuff and putt in where you want in your spirit world. It just moves there.  Compton says, 'I dunno... what's alive feel like?' Compton asks, and knowing him it would prolly mean a strippers boob pressed up again his face, in fact except for the shape, that's kinda what if eeels like it dawn on him, 'Like a square tit.' is his final summarization of the experience.'  The spirit stuff is rather pliable. Kinda like a thick play-doh.  Penny grabs a washcloth and wipes down the doorway til it's back to white. She looks down at her own and fingers the edge of her shirt 'That's what came out of that Thing, made the screaming. It's not a *boob*, you boob. I..' squinting at it, or the space where it is, '..wonder. You remember that time we were in Jesse's place and he was talkin'some garbage about things taking their own form?'  Compton says, 'I know it's not a boob, I said it felt like one.'  Compton pulls off the gloves and pushes the goggles back up on to his forhead, looking back at Penny, 'Um, huh?' is his brillant response to her Jesse inquiry.  'Well look at it. That's not how it started out, is it? Nothing natural about it,' Penny, leaping to conclusion, sits on the edge of the tub leaving the toilet, seat and lid down, for Compton to sit on. 'What is it... is it 'the word made flesh'? Fuck, Daze's never around .. ' Then, 'Gimme a cigarette.'  Escalus has disconnected. Escalus has connected.  OOC> Escalus says 'Sorry about that.' OOC> Compton says 'Sokie. I got a shower in at least. :D' OOC> Escalus had to disconnect because a patron came in. What were you doing? OOC> Compton says 'No poses since you left. Penny and me are throwing out ideas as to whay our new found spirit thingy pet is.' OOC> Escalus says 'I will allow a int + occult roll, diff. 8.' OOC> Penny says 'ugh. BACK!' OOC> Penny's machine crashed like three times.  Compton frowns and just nods along to your stream of counsiousness, and offers a useless, 'I don't know' here and there, before scowling at Penny, 'You know... Sooner of later one of you kids will realize, I don't smoke, until that time let me give you a hint...' then his eyes unfocus a bit and he stares off in tot he void as his brain tries to grunt out a thought....  //.etro: Compton rolls 'intelligence+occult' at diff 8          For a total of 0 success(es). No entry for '+roll'. OOC> Penny says 'Me next?' ...and comes up with jack shit, as usual. OOC> Escalus says 'Yep.' //.etro: Penny rolls 'intelligence + occult' at diff 8          For a total of 3 success(es) including 2 ten(s).  Penny remembers that spirit ephemera is essentially nothing until it gains a sort of resonance depending on what happens in the materials world around it. For example, a church that stood on a spot for 150 years gains a certain degree of reality in the spirit world, one that can continue after the material church is destroyed. Right?  'Old man,' a whine, a warning. 'It's not for me, I mean if I could just ask one'a them it'd be easier than staring at this thing all day.' But that's what she does. Penny stares this way, that way. She looks up, she looks down; fixated on some central point of origin.  OOC> Escalus says 'You follow me so far?' OOC> Penny follows. OOC> Compton does. OOC> Compton isn't quite as thick as his IC persona :P  Sentient spirits are products of millenia of that sort of spirit-material collusion. For example, lunes are spirits made by the connection between the material moon and the real moon, which is very potent in the mind and spirit of man.  This stuff is most probably spirit ephemera rendered neutral. The interaction between a material object and its spiritual counterpart has been removed, and the 'imprint' of the soul's relationship between spiritual and material has been erased.  Compton frowns, grumbles and hauls his ass off the can and shuffles off out in to the rest of the room. The sounds of rummaging and things crashing to the floor can be heard as he ruthlessly looks for tobacco products. After a long quiet moment, he calls back, 'And it wouldn't because you happened to be out of them, right?'.  'No, not at all,' looking at the walls. 'Oh.' 'God.' 'That's why they were screaming.'  Penny bends over a little to poke at what she can't touch, unable to interact with it, her fingers drift slowly across the empty tub. 'It's ..it's clay. You know what this is old man? it's a fucking hard drive. It's a big block of memoryspace,' she shivers and gets off the tub, goes to meet Compton halfway 'it's empty. That's why they were screaming. All torn apart. Peter Pan and his shadow,' making some kind of corollation she takes the cigarette from him and lights up on her own, matches tucked back into her pocket 'You think I'd make a good Wendy?'  Compton tosses the pack he found back over by Keene's notebook. 'OKay... well, I guess the next question is, why?'  Compton doesn't seem particularly upset by this. His connection to the spirit world having always eebn one of utility and not, um, spirit. He then guffaws, 'Hee, Wendy.'  Penny smirks a little, the hotel sewing kit in plain sight on the bathroom counter. 'Obviously they're bent on getting something rooted in there good and proper. Solid-like. Stealing material like that, god. It's sick. Sick. There's gotta be karma for shit like that... '  Compton grabs the bag, and collects the gloves from the edge of the tub where he left them. Putting them in to the bag he gazes at the 'empty' tub and shrugs. 'They're making a building from ectoplasim?' he asks trying to clairfy what you're babbling about.  Penny bobs her head back and forth, a veering nod 'Kinda sorta, yeah. They're building something but they're doing it on a festering node. I dunno,' waving a pattern of smoke around her face, leaning on the wall outside the bathroom 'Something just isn't right. I mean that material BELONGS to something other than whatever new purpose they're trying to make it serve. Wouldn't wanna be around when it tries to repossess itself.' She drags long and slow '.. not me, man. They're crazy.'  Compton sratched at his forhead, thinking. Getting marks for effort, if not results on this one, 'Right...' he says, 'BUt They don't just do things for kicks like that. They doing it for a reason... Okay, so they got a sick node. And now they have a lot of blank ectoplasma. Either they are trying to make corrupted ephemera or a clean node.' Points at the empty tub, 'Ya think they're using this stuff as sponges?'  You say, 'Sponges,' repeats the word, musing 'there's easier, less destructive ways of getting a spill cleaned up. If you had heard what I heard?' a hurting, a wincing lilt in the exhale 'Maybe if we can get our hands on all this stuff first we can get it sorted. Think we should? Isn't creating a problem to fix a problem a problem in and of itself?'  Compton says, 'I guess the next question is: How much of this stuff have they made?'  Penny walks across the room and opens the window, letting the air circulate back into the room. 'I'm thinking a lot. Which means there's a lot of displaced information somewhere else.' She ashes on the windowsill and leans there, kicking off her shoes. 'Probably on that ship. Where the fuck did it go?'  Compton pads over to the far bed, and does the little hop-up flop-down on the bed. The coil protesting loudly.  > 'Well... where did it come from? You're the one that saw it come in.' Compton says, 'And further more, what use would they have keeping the... 'other halfs' if this ectoplasm is all they wanted...If I were them I'd just dump it.'  You say, 'Deep space,' she ashes again into the sill and presses her palm down for balance, balast. Her other boot comes off, focused inward a little '..but where do you dump something like that? Way the fuck out there, that's where. It's not like orange peels - the identity of a spirit can't just disintegrate.'  'That's not what Daze said.' Compton counters. 'She said old spirits are fading away all the time. The Easter Bunny for example... but then she's usually full fo shit anyways. But assuming what she said is right, then dumping it somewhere would work as eventually it'd just fade... Unless they're reprocessing the other halves too... Hell, could even be using them for fuel.' That last point can out far more erie than he meant.  Keene has connected. You say, 'She thinks they fade outta unbelief - old gods, the Mithras cults, things like out. Fade outta disuse. But .. that's not what I meant. I'm saying they've still got some ..' pinching her fingers, sliding them together 'consistancy. That' block,' nodding toward the bathrooom 'that's proof. One can exist without the other but we don't know for how long and what the longterm effects are. Like I said..'  Compton tucks his thick arms under his head as an added pillow and gazes at the ceiling, 'What did you say?' he asks distractedly.  Penny keeps rubbing her fingers against her thumb, laughing quietly to herself. In the grip of it, pin-points for eyes, Penny hasn't seen Keene come in. Penny is unaware. 'I said I wouldn't wanna be there for the happy reunion of spirit'n blocky. Listen, we should definitely go back and get more. They're fucking with my bread and butter here.'  'It'd be easier with some help.' the big guy admits, 'Will take a while to grab each one by hand. Could make a ecto-magnet or somthing. Just suck it all here in one go... But I thought you said you don wanna be around where the two rejoin, and won't you be if we fill the bathroom with it?'  There's a long silence. The ash on her cigarette burns down to the filter, singes her out of whatever reverie.  'You have a point.'  'Maybe we can hide it on them. Put it somewhere they can't find it. They're playing dirty, is what, and I don't like it. Shouldn't be this easy for them. Why the fuck is it so easy for them?'  Compton snorts 'Should dump it in the realm. Let those fuckholes actually do somthing useful for once.'  'Fuckholes.' Says something quietly, underneath the bed.  Penny stops moving altogether, filter falling from her hand.  'I.thought.you.said.it.was.in.the.fucking.closet.'  Penny looks about ready to jump out the window. Compton is grinning now, 'I never said anything actually.... Mornin Dave.' Compton says out in to the room.  'I fucking hate you, I hate you I HATE you old man.' She gets up in the windowsill, inching her hand down the wall to grab one of her boots. Paranoid, she does it fast and holds it close to her chin 'Don't you let it near me. You hear, Dave? You leave me alone. I'm in no fucking mood.'  Compton props hismself up on one elbow and looks on incrediously. He's seen Penny in most her moods. Even freaked out,but this is just bizzare, 'What's the problem?'  Penny tucks the boot behind her and grabs the other one. Her eyes are narrowed, a dizziness overtakng her sense of center, Penny starts to keel off the sill. Wait. No. She's stepping down into the boot. She's grabbing the other one and putting it on 'Dave. Don't come out Dave. I'm leaving. You hear me? Don't come out or I'll be forced to do something.' All this said as she edges toward the door to the room.  Compton swings his legs off the bed and hunches down looking under it, 'What's the big deal Pens? It's just a monkey...' he says in all ingnorance, as he sticks his hand underneight the bed to look for the lil guy....  > Yeow!' Compton screams, 'Fucker bit me!' as he sits back holding his tender mit.  Penny murmurs 'Fucking monkey,' on her way out.

179,179,1151815,1,25,"       Novus Valnastium -- Main Chamber          The main hall of Novus Valnastium is a wide, stone area, with arching buttresses and columns framing windows that stream with bright, comfortable light. Several circles of chairs and old-fashioned divans and davenports are scattered around the room, conversational areas if you will, and a center hearth flickers with a warm, comfortable flame. A set of stairs on the left leads up to a balcony that rings the area, several doors leading off it, and great double doors lead forward and to the left, right, and behind you. Two armored figures, silent as the grave, flank the doors ahead of you, as well as two others flanking the doors to the rear, which lead back out onto the open plains.  Contents: Catherine Alex Viktor Niko Obvious exits: Out to Fields    Laboratory Doors    Library Doors    Council Chambers     You return IC ...   Niko smiles, 'She gave up her family and friends to be with me..I don't want her caught because I didn't get the best...and she doesn't know who she wants to lead..'    Viktor says 'night' Viktor has disconnected. Niko looks to Alex, 'Besides...I'm going to push their offer to provide support and see if it's serious  Viktor thinks for a moment and heads to the library. 'Well, I'm off to do some research. I'll see you all later.'  //.etro: It is 06:10 am, early morning, on Sunday the 22. day of March, 2009.  'Later,'Alex says to Viktor with a small nod as the man heads toward the library.  Was Penny always there? Hard to say, things not being as linear as they could be. Regardless, she's there now. Between a few short, quick steps her phone beeps and while it may be true that certain grids can not be accessed out here in the nowhere, other particular matricies are always available.  Skirting the hearth, she advances on a place just to the left of the library. Just a few days ago a shroud of a sort was laid out. The strong smell hovers in that general area but nowhere else in the hall.  The phone is still beeping when Penny tugs it, and a smoke, out of her pocket. She thumbs the buttons for a few seconds until it's quiet.  Cassius pages: Alright, you get a message back saying. Wil du. Luv u. You paged Cassius with 'Texting back: Body was hidden .. here? Need 2 bring it 2 our place.'. Cassius pages: Hard 2 do Big guys will stop. You paged Cassius with 'Y? We need 2 lay him 2 rest. 2morrow. things 2 do.'. Cassius pages: Big guys wont let me take things from the place You paged Cassius with 'Will carry him myself then. where is he?'.   Catherine looks at you She says something short in a language you don't understand.  she yawns...hiding it behind her hand.  Alex glances over to Penny when she step into the room. 'Come back for the rest of Chase?...' he asks her, a slight frown coming to his face.  Niko smiles to Cathy, 'then come and curl up with me and I'll carry you to bed after..'  Connelly 's sleeping on the floor in a corner of the room.... Catherine does just so, resting her head against Niko..  Penny has the bearing and mien of a person teetering on the far side of rational. Her shoulders too stiff, her posture too erect. The corner of her mouth twists, up. Down. The dead-white crust in corners, she is thin-lipped. Her gaze fixes on the phone. She thumbs something out on the keypad and looks toward Alex, her eyes rimmed red and peeled wide open 'Yes.'  Catherine does fall asleep...  'Oh,'Alex says with a smirk, almost a chuckle,'Too bad he is not here... But I am curious... What is it that you had planned to do with Chase's head and body?...'  Niko sits on a divan with Cathy salseep and resting across his lap as he toys with her hair and just watches on  Taliesin enters the Hall from the Library. Taliesin has arrived.  Taliesin comes out of the library and starts walking in the direction of the council chambers.  Niko sees tal enter and doesn't pause to say hello or anything else, 'tal..you wouldn't be an Adept of Ars Animae by any chance...woul dyou?'  Alex is standing by the hearth in the same area where Niko is seated. His eyes, however, are on Penny. Perhaps waiting for a response or a reaction.  Taliesin comes to a halt when Niko addresses him, 'An Adept of Ars Anime? No, I'm afraid not. I've been focusing my studies on the sphere of Prime lately. Why what do you need a Life adept for?'  Niko smiles to tal, 'Well..now I have to add to my request..need an Adept of Life to make the changes to Cathy..I can change my face..not hers  The tap-click-beep-beep noise of Penny-with-the-phone is a constant throughout the conversation. She doesn't look down as she types, operating by feel. A sandpaper sound comes out where her voice is requisite 'It was said already. There is a letter to follow, instructions' she emphasizes 'hoc monumentum heredem exterum non sequitur.'  It's possible that she believe this should make sense.   Taliesin ahs softly, 'I may have a solution to that. I'll get to work on it.' He glances over at Penny, 'How are you using a cellphone here? I can't believe you're even within roaming range. I know mine doesn't work?'  'And when I asked to see this... letter, while you were stealing Chase's head at gun point, you gave me an envelope full of dried leaves....' Alex says in response to Penny's statement,'I would think that, as a leader of this Chantry, what is done with Chase's body is a Chantry matter.'  Pobble enters the Main Hall through the Fields, closing the massive double doors behind him. Pobble has arrived.  'I never pointed a gun at you, Alex' her declaration a means to free her from that conversation, ending with 'we are his next-of-kin and are due his remains.' Quiet for a few minutes while she rearranges the three shrouds ontop of one another, Penny pockets the phone 'It doesn't work,' pushing the jet stones and other detrius into the center of the plastic sheets 'it only talks to god.'  Kneeling, Penny looks at her work, unsatisfied and fixated.  Pobble pushes the door open, allowing a suited monkey to scamper through, trailing a luminescent exhaust of cigar fumage in its wake. Sashaying behind the smokestack is a hooded man, black coat worn closed with the oversized hood shrouding his features in shadow. The fine shoes tap on the stone, as the man follows monkey into the chamber. A cigarette dangles precariously from thin blood stained fingers, the claret glinting fresh as the cherry ember sparkles on silver fingernails.  The pair come to a stop, suddenly and as one. The motion whips the heavy smoke around and in an overly dramatic manner, the fellow throws back his hood. The empty eyes of Dr Steve are revealed. Emaciated and haggard, his head shifts in the only indication that he scans the room, given the blank eyes.  Taliesin nods slowly to Penny, her commentary about her cellphone's abilities at communion being left alone for now. He asks, expecting that someone will know the answers, 'Where is the body now? It should be handed over to them, as soon as possible. When will the College be holding the memorial? I know that myself and some others would like to attend.'  Niko hmms a little, 'It's not a memorial they are doing...not right off, anyway..'  //.etro: It is 07:28 am, mid-morning, on Sunday the 22. day of March, 2009.  Alex let's out a sharp bark of a laugh,'Is /that/ what they were doing when they hacked into Chase's head with a kitchen knife?... Preparing for a memorial?...' he asks seeming rather doubtful of that explaination.  Taliesin raises a finger to the two Virtual Adepts, 'Gentlemen, before you start in on defending the dignity of the corpse of a man that neither one of you was particularly fond of, I would like to speak with Penny about this. As a leader of the Chantry it is right that I should do so.' He motions for Penny, Pobble and Dave to join him in the library.   Niko gives Tal a look and frowns a bit, 'Make sure you run a lie detector..'  Penny stops what she was doing with the positioning of the plastic, muttering something about the squares not holding the circles. She stops because Pobble walked in. Instinct guides a hand from the floor to her side, the way a person looking to arm themselves might keep a loaded gun. The left hand from the floor to her right side stays there and does not move.  Dave Monkey nods, 'S'right.' he says slowly, waving his cigar around indignantly. 'I'd have said he'd've rather 'ad is head cut awf that spent a quiet weekend with yous.' The obnoxiously little monkey begins to swagger across towards Taliesin. The latter comment from Niko causes the fella to stop and he goes to say something but a following Pobble ends the statement pre-emptively with a kick to the rear. The monkey moves on but Dr Steve pauses to stare at Niko, 'You are certainly full of insinuations today young man..' he says in a hoarse whisper, dried blood flaking on his cracked lips. 'You should becareful where you aim such weapons of disunity.' This said, he moves towards Penny and offers her his arm.  Niko glances to Dave and smiles, 'If daisy had not told me precisely what you all were looking to do, then I would not be so worried with your behavior..'. He offers an obvious fake smile to Dave, 'And don't go calling me 'young man'.'  Seemingly amused by Dave's antics, Taliesin offers Niko a slight smile, 'I'm sure I can handle things just fine.' He stands patiently waiting for the members of the Invisible College to proceed him into the library.  'First of all, Tal,'Alex says turning toward the man,'You are wrong about me not liking my former cabalmate. And second, Penny would not of had to come here, guns drawn, if there was any explaination as to what they were doing with Chase's head and body.'           This fine gentleman is probably in the 25-30 age bracket, and is posessed of an unhealthy pallor, his skin having a washed out look to it as if he's been dry cleaned one too many times. Haircut looks to be home made, low grade clippers job but just a little patchy in places where there are hints of blue in the stubble. His eyes are apparently fitted with some form of contact lens, since they are a pale milky white with no iris or pupil visible. His pallid skin is contrasted by the adornments that mark it. Besides the peircings (1) there are numerous tattoos, the main design being a series of small black marks that ring his head in a strip about an inch wide reminiscent of a crown of thorns laden with black ink. Under his left eye, starting at the peak of the cheekbone are three thin vertical black lines, varying sizes with the middle the longest at about an inch. Finally, an abstract design formed from intersecting black and white squares, about the size of a silver dollar adorns his neck on the right.          Dressed to impress in a four figure suit in a black that purposefully looks a touch faded. Its appears to have been fitted perfectly, but the stylistic crispness is convoluted into a more casual style by virtue of an unbuttoned jacket, and the white crinkled silk shirt worn untucked with its top button open. The cuffs of the shirt protrude at perfect lengths, fastened with flat round headed cuffs consisting of blank white circles. The hands that emerge from the expert tailoring are also thin and on the pale side, accentuated by patches of dried blood (2). Precisely pressed and creased pants with precision turnups and length are finished up by a pair of stylish black shoes that appear both classy and designed for duty with thick soles and what could be steel toe caps.          Cold repelling is perfomed by a full length black crushed velvet overcoat, apparently with an added inner lining. In contrast to the fine attire beneath, the velvet hasn't held up too well in the snow and rain and is starting to become patchy in places while having that drowned rat look to it while wet. It has an oversized hood, and deep out-side pockets.          He speaks with a South London accent, sounding quite common at times no matter the covabluary he wields. He moves wearily, as if each motion is a true feat of willpower and each step a mile.      Penny seems to wince at the offer, seems to recoil from Pobble or Dave, seems to give a great deal of consideration to his extended hand and none at all to the conversation going on around her. Equal parts fear and delerium keep her quite motionless, a wide open stare travelling slowly upwards. Caught her own reflection in the shine of Pobble's shoes, Penny winces again.  '..not just yet,' she whispers to the steel toes, taking his bloodied hand. Is it then that her hand becomes red as well? or was it before... 'cycle hasn't resolved.'  Dave Monkey mutters as he heads into the library, casting a look back at Niko, pointing his cigar as if it were a rifle. It could be, its the right size. No shot however, Dave Monkey, saving the lives of those he despises. He whispers into the momentary silence. 'I have every right to call you boy if I wish. Do not condescend the monkey. The monkey is ancient. The monkey has many friends across many layers of existence. The monkey takes no prisoners.' This is said with remarkable venom.  Dr Steve smiles, sadly. As if an act of simple kindness had destroyed the world. A slight nod, and a gentle squeeze of Pen's hand. He then leads her to the library in silence. There is an air of resignation about his motions when close to Penny, his wasted features growing sadder still.  'I think the chimp just threatened you Niko,'Alex says as he moves to take a seat in a nearby armchair.  Niko looks to Alex, 'He'll throw feces next, I'm sure..'  You head to the door marked 'Library' and head through into the room beyond. Novus Valnastium -- Library          High shelves, comfortable chairs, warm lights, and wide tables adorn this room. Large rugs of various types of fur spread out, here and there. On one wall is a hearth that seems to always burn with a quiet, warm flame. This room is a bibliophile's dream, with books on magick, books on history, in fact, books on almost anything one might think about.         Currently, most of the books are still away, packed in Hermetically sealed crates which line the walls of the room. Soon, though, the boxes will be unpacked and the library will be complete.  Obvious exits: Out     Pobble enters the Library from the Main Hall. Pobble has arrived.  Taliesin enters the Library from the Main Hall. Taliesin has arrived.  Taliesin follows shortly thereafter and closes the door behind him. He looks at the three of you, 'Can you guys tell me what's going on? I'm more than willing to help you memorialize Chase, but I need to know what the hub bub is all about.'  Dave Monkey says, 'Awright Tal me ole mucka.' The indignance of youth forgotten it seems, the Monkey hops into a chair and performs admirably the task of looking happy for the entire Colledge. Matted fur around the eyes attests otherwise maybe, but for now those saucer pupils are filled with something that resembles glee.  Dr Steve comes to stand near Dave. Releasing Penny he seems to slump down as if a great weight has been returned to his neck, Steve Atlas. The chair seems to be the only thing supporting his defiance of the tyranny of gravity. His head shifts, eyes possibly moving to Penny to allow her to explain.   The monkey, ill conceived little steward that he is, leads the way for the strained couple. She folds herself down to the side of the chair, not for lack of strength but because just at that moment Dave, Pobble and Penny exist in a kind of Raphaelite symmetry.  'It's to do with dates. Time, really. It's the right time.' A pause, her voice still paperthin and erraticly octaved 'Um. I'm sorry who are you? I don't think we've .. met.'   The other two nod solemnly at this. Eerily in time with one another. Questioning looks await response.  This earns a look for Dr. Steve and Dave from Taliesin. He sighs and grips his white oak staff taking a deep breath before speaking, 'Penny, I am Taliesin Emrys. I'm a Celestial Chorister and I'm a friend of Chase. I'm trying to figure out what is going on with his remains that has caused such a problem. I'm not understanding your explanation, so if you could try to explain it to me, more simply. I'd appreciate it.'  Penny ohs, maybe making a mental note. Studying Tal, intent on his staff, his posture, she brings a knee up, readjusting her position on the floor. Hooking an elbow around it, she rests her head, a dark bloodied palm-print left on the black jeans.   'It isn't my .. I haven't got the words ..' a pregnant pause, like she's waiting for an invitation.  Taliesin is really trying here, 'Ms. Ante, I need you to try please. This is causing trouble that Chase would not have wished. I want to help you do right by Chase, but I need you to help me do that.'  //.etro: Penny rolls 'arete' at diff 4          For a total of 1 success(es).  Penny shifts again to pull a notepad and a sharpie from the apron pocket she sits on. There's another uncomfortable moment where Penny just stares at Tal. All processes pending circulation. The sense of muted urgency breaks when she teeths the cap off, grips the pen. In a quick hand she writes the words REQUIESCAT IN PACE on the notepad, a rectangle, scribbles that look nothing like the english-letter alphabet, a discoball, a television and seven stick-figures in a circle. She rips the page off the top, a bloody thumbprint set squarely inside the stick-figures.  'Here, here' holding the note out for him.  Taliesin takes the paper, looks at it and nods. 'I see. What were you guys doing with his head though? Was there something you were trying to get out?'  Pobble has disconnected.  It's not the strongest projection ever built but it conveys enough; that they're giving Chase his due; a bacchanal.  Penny slumps back to the chair and looks up at Pobble before rasping, scratching something from the corner of her mouth 'His skull of course. And the pieces that did not belong to him. Part of the deal. Return to sender.'  Taliesin ahs softly, 'He had some sort of implant then? And you guys were taking it out to send it back to the person who gave it to him?'  Penny nods, folding away the notepad, capping the marker. It isn't so much that she's dumb or mute but that she can not get cohesive. A twitch here, a shiver there; subtle signs of a hunger strike.  Taliesin nods slowly, 'Very well. I will have the body ready for the Invisible College to take care of in short order. If you would let me know who you're sending the implant to as well, so I can make sure they receive it, and so the others will know what's going on. I would appreciate that as well.'  Taliesin sings a few bars under his breath and the pangs of hunger and deprivation fade into memory. He smiles, 'No need to suffer like that any longer, Ms. Ante.'  Penny shouts, 'NO!'  Taliesin takes a step back, 'What's the matter? Are you alright? I'll have the body for you as soon as I can. There was no need.' He looks worried that perhaps he has done something wrong unintentionally.  Penny lurches forward like she could reach what was just slipped out of her grasp. She makes a noise, a wail, a cry 'No! It's necessary! The letter.. ' looking at Pobble who has succumbed, has passed out or slipped unconcious for minutes at a time. She raises fingers to her mouth, still chapped? '..you don't know anything!'  Taliesin smacks himself on the forehead. 'My apologies.' He looks ashamed of himself. 'I was only trying to help. I will set you back the way you were, Ms. Ante, but before I do, is one of you remaining healthy enough to plan the bacchanal?'  Dave panicks and scoots out of sight. He's seen Penny at her shrieking, terrorizing worst, he knows better than to stick around.  'It's done,' getting up knees to feet 'Put it back, give it back,' stumbling down as she crosses the room, tripping over the apron strings. '..give it back..'  Penny shouts, 'Put it back, give it back!'  Taliesin nods, 'I shall.' He pulls out a stick on incense, 'This is very important, before you leave, I want you to take this and burn it. I'm going to put a blessing on it that the Chorus often uses when subjecting ourselves to similar privation. If you burn it those who inhale the smoke of the incense will be able to endure your privation with greater grace. It is up to you if you wish to use it, but I respect what you're doing and want to help.' He bows his head, 'Lord, please forgive Your servant who has interfered with the sacrifice of another, please forgive me my foolish pride and restore the sacrifice made in the name of a friend.' The pains of hunger wrack your body once more and once again it becomes difficult to think clearly due to your grumbling and forlorn stomach. He focuses on the incense and prays over it for a few moments and puts it in your bloodied hand.    Taliesin says 'Eseentially if you burn it, anyone in the area who inhales the smoke will be able to deal with extreme hunger... think of it as a stamina boost directed toward exactly that.'   Taliesin says 'I need to go nini now.'   Penny says 'That's excellent.'   Penny says 'I'll letcha go. Say. Before you go?'   Taliesin says 'Yes?'   Penny says 'You're getting the body to us ..so that means I don't have to haul it out of here myself?'    Taliesin says 'Right.'   Taliesin says 'Just let me know where you need it to go with a +mail or the like.'   Penny says 'Okay. Thank you. This was excellent.'   Taliesin will have to recover it first of course, but that's my problem now.   Penny nodsnods. Taliesin leaves by way of the double doors, entering the Main Hall. Taliesin has left.   You open the double doors, returning to the Main Hall. Novus Valnastium -- Main Chamber          The main hall of Novus Valnastium is a wide, stone area, with arching buttresses and columns framing windows that stream with bright, comfortable light. Several circles of chairs and old-fashioned divans and davenports are scattered around the room, conversational areas if you will, and a center hearth flickers with a warm, comfortable flame. A set of stairs on the left leads up to a balcony that rings the area, several doors leading off it, and great double doors lead forward and to the left, right, and behind you. Two armored figures, silent as the grave, flank the doors ahead of you, as well as two others flanking the doors to the rear, which lead back out onto the open plains.  Contents: Alex Niko Connelly Obvious exits: Out to Fields    Laboratory Doors    Library Doors    Council Chambers      Alex is seated quietly in one of the armchair, his shade covered eyes looking in the direction of the library door.  The library door opens again. And Penny doesn't so much walk out as she shuffles between short spasms of breath. By and large this was the way she entered the room but for the very faint, very thin sheen of sweat that's broken across her features. Even now as she returns to the hall this sweat seems to be evaporating, her left hand still bloodied. The strings of the apron are rednow as well and her knee bears a dark handprint.  'What,' she rasps 'you were expecting someone else?'  Alex doesn't bother to answer Penny's question and his eyes don't move either. In fact, he doesn't move much at all.  Penny shrugs her jacket back the right way, the nylon making that slithery noise as she zippers it. 'Whatever. Jackass.' Short on words and patience in low supply, she stuffs her fists into the pockets. Penny walks toward the door slowly; her body just as stiffly resolute as when she walked in.  A faint smile creeps to Alex lips; as if Penny's words where a victory on his part. Still he remains silent and still.  Penny snorts then starts coughing. It's a terrible, colicky sound that rattles from deep, deep in the lung. She stops to try and control it, working the flem up, up and spits it to the stone floor.  Spitting on the truth, some people call it. She wipes her mouth with the back of her hand and leaves the hall still clearing her throat.

186,186,1151815,1,25,"       Naoko pages: Late last night, around 2:30 am, a really bizarre paradox ripple fluttered over the town. The epicenter seemed to have been from somewhere far off in the woods, about 10 miles outside of town. Naoko pages: Is that bait enough?  Gabbi State Park - Park Entrance(#675RJs)          The tall buildings may be seen off in the horizon, but obviously this area is not one of static business. Instead, the only real remains of city life are seen in the often crowded parking lot of the state park, vehicles of all sorts packed into the small parking spaces. It is one of the few parking spots that automobiles of every price can be found, everything from the latest BMW to the old Honda with a rusty bumper.         Up ahead, adjacent to the parking lot the actual entrance to the park is visible. A small ranger station is the first thing visible, where a ranger can be seen at all times manning the station and answering any question that may come up. Smaller booths are set up as well, selling various overpriced camping gear, t-shirts, as well as maps of the area.  Contents: Naoko Obvious exits: Gravel Road to Cabin GR  South S  East E  North on Gabbi N  It's night. It's breezy out. It's a bit chilly. Of course, the gal walking up the street seems to pay no heed to this. She's wandering, a bit confused, stopping from time to time and looking at the sky. When she does, she holds some sort of weird-looking binoculars up to her eyes. A frown, and she shakes her head. 'God! Another five miles, at LEAST.' Japanese accent; English definately not the first language. Naoko is looking at you.  The stillness of the night air is threatened by the sound of wet gravel being displaced from the road. Halogen brights tear the darkness apart as a behemothic Hummer meanders into view. The rain slick roads are no match for its traction but the driver doesn't seem to be the most competent, swerving and meandering over the road for no apparent reason. The vehicle slows as it nears the gates, a window lowering to allow the crisp air to enter and consequently push out the stale noxious smoke from within the cabin.  The girl leaps and almost drops her binoculars, catching them at the last minute. 'Ohmigod. A car!' She stuffs the binoculars in the large duffel bag at her side and goes running, top speed, for it, waving her hands wildly. 'WAIT! WAIT!' she yells, at the top of her lungs.  There is a crunching as brakes engage, the SUV grinding to a halt just in front of the woman. The interior is dark, windows tinted. Up close and out of the direct view of the blinding lights its easy to notice that the relatively new vehicle is banged up, scratched and not in the best of states. Smoke is exhaled through the open window and a tired voice calls out from within. 'Awright there?'  The girl gasps, a bit out of breath, and takes a moment to get her bearings. 'Yes.. no... I mean.. I guess so... Uhh... Hi.' Naoko smiles oddly. 'I.. uh... ' She stops, and her eyes roam toward the sky, 'Could I get a ride? I... I am kind of stuck.'          Brilliant! That's the first word that usually pops to one's lips upon looking at this spry teenager: brilliant in her actions, brilliant in her speech, and, my god, brilliant in her appearance. Wherever this girl goes, she's always walking on sunshine. First, the basics. She's young, a teenager, around 15 or so years old. The heritage is clearly Japanese, for all of the features tell it true - the warm shade of her skin, the delicately sloped eyes of deep brown, the pert and gentle nose. China Girl, at first glance one might think, but unmistakably, she's Japanese. When she speaks, her accent most certainly confirms the ethnicity, while the times that she has to pause for her words confirms that English isn't her first language, either. A gal of small stature, she's only about 5'1' tall, and can't weigh more than 95 pounds, dripping wet. However, she more than makes up for that with the bold manner with which she presents herself. The jet black hair is cut short, feathered in the front like a flock of seagulls, and with an unhealthy amount of serious gel, she wears it spiked in every which direction, so that her silhouette looks like a starburst. Furthermore, the hair is streaked with vibrant electric blue, adding color to the mix. Her every action seems as if it were driven by a live current, with the setting cranked all the way up to 'hyper-manic.'          The future's so bright, you gotta wear shades - and the same is true for her clothing. She's dressed like she's ready to party like it's 1999. A white ringer t-shirt with the Pac-Man logo on it, and the words 'Pac-Man Fever' is worn across her chest, decorated with red rings at the neck and sleeves. Over that, she wears a screaming neon yellow shirt, patterned with aqua blue swooshes that look like they were streaked on with quick strokes of a paintbrush. The skirt she wears is a bold black-and-white checkerboard pattern, and it flares out from her hips, reaching down to a few inches above her knee. Looking lower, she's got matching yellow leg warmers, pulled up to her knees, and stopping just above a pair of very retro-looking Keds - white with neon pink stripes, and neon pink shoelaces. The accessorizing is mostly in neon pink, from the Swatch Watch on her wrist that tells the time with artistically crooked hands over a light-up face, complete with a clear pink jelly-style wristband, to the giant neon pink plastic hoops that dangle from her earlobes. On each wrist is no less than 50 jelly bracelets in a rainbow of colors, intermixed with a few hand-woven friendship bands. Finally, the outfit is completed by blinding you with science: the overcoat that sweeps airily down to her knees is made of that technologically-innovative HyperColour (TM) fabric - the kind that changes color with changes in temperature. This one is in screaming orange, with spots of bright purple on it, indicating the warmer spots, and it's finished off with a chartreuse button on the lapel that reads, 'Doc Brown was an amateur!' And that is Naoko - more fun than ninety-nine red balloons. Well, what do you expect? Girls do just wanna have fun!  The door opens, and the driver hops out. A cigarette hangs precariously from between his thin fingers and is ashed with the movement, grey rain floating down across his coat. He wrinkles his nose as he looks the girl over, then peers past her towards the sky with a curious expression as he takes a long slow drag. 'Folks go home without you?' he enquires distantly. View items have been set on the following objects in your area:  If it were possible to shade such a sunny disposition, it did just happen. A wave of distress over her face, and the young woman nods. 'Uh.. Yeah..' she trails off, reaching over to zip up her duffel bag. 'Something like that.' Pobble nods slowly, needlessly tapping his dwindling cigarette. He seems preoccupied with the night sky, staring up at it past the girl. The clouds are pregnant with heavy rain fall, and he steps past you towards the gates slowly. 'Awful that is mate.' he mumbles. Strangely, smoke continues to drift from the hummer, as if another ciggy had been left burning within. Or maybe there's more people inside. 'Where'd you live?'  Her wide eyes shiver a little. 'Uhm... Reno? Nevada?' Spoken as if she, herself, weren't sure about the detail. 'I... yes, that was the last place I lived.. I.. I do believe.' 'Christ on a bike.' murmers the man. He's tapping his cigarette in a rythmic pattern, silver tipped thumb hitting the filter where the four corners of a square about it would be. As he does so he shifts it up and down, up and down. 'Maybe they left you here on purpose.' he observes, the blunt suggestion being stated with the same dreamy air. He's not really paying full attention to the conversation. Something else is more interesting.  Pobble rolls 3 (3 dice) at a difficulty of 4:  9 5 9 Achieving 3 successes, resulting in a complete success.  OOC Naoko says, 'what is that for?' OOC Pobble does a Prime sense, to check for anything going on in the foresty area. You could make an Awareness roll.. About ten miles to the south and west of here, there's the fading away of a source of primal energy... like a battery draining the last of its juice.  Naoko rolls perception+awareness vs 6 (3 dice) at a difficulty of 0:  8 7 9 Achieving 3 successes, resulting in a complete success.  OOC Naoko says, 'weird. it only rolled half my dicepool. ah well.' OOC Pobble says, 'Hrm. Either way'  The japanese kid shakes her head tightly, 'No. They'd never, ever, ever do that. My parents love me very ... very.. much...' And she can barely choke out the last word, before tears start streaming out of her eyes.  Crying teenagers. The sound of sadness seems to draw Pobble from whatever trance he was settling into and he sucks the last from his cigarette before flicking it into the night. It skitters on the wet road and fizzles quietly. Turning, he moves to stand next to the girl, going to put a hand on her shoulder but seeming unsure and deciding against it at the last moment. 'Hey. Sorry.' He looks about sideways, searching for backup. Finding none, his lips twist into an uncertain grimace. 'It'll be okay?'  Sniffly and still sobby, she replies, 'Truth... truth is... I don't know where they are... something terrible happened... and... I don't even know where -I- am. In a big stupid forest or something... I don't like it out here.' In the vehicle, something scrabbles at the rear window. It's impossible to make out a shape inside with the darkness and the tinting. Pobble ignores it and settles back against the wet Hummer. 'So eh.. How did you get here?' he asks, sounding almost curious.  She turns and peers at the window, taking a step away to try to glance inside. 'I..' She sniffs. 'I sort of... sort of..' She chews on her lip for a moment, 'Wrecked my car.' Not a very good liar.  A small shillouette vanishes down away from the window. Pobble just stares, looking close to sympathetic but mostly confused and awkward. He's obviously not used to crying teenage girls in the middle of the road at night. 'Where at? Want me to call the police?' he asks after a few moments silence, and not sounding too set on the idea.   Pobble rolls 3 (3 dice) at a difficulty of 4:  5 4 10 Achieving 3 successes, resulting in a complete success.  She's clearly all sparkly. That much is obvious. But the most prevelant emotions are confusion and fear. Confusion, specifically. This girl has no idea where she is, what she's doing, what day it is... none of it. She's afraid, really afraid - afraid of what she'll do next, what'll become of her, and especially afraid for her parents. Underlying it all is a clearly highly creative and intelligent young woman who far surpasses most her age with her innovativeness.  Naoko shakes her head tightly, and says, 'No... No sir... I... I was driving without a license, see... and... I don't want to go to jail.' More terrible lies, the kind that she can barely keep a lid on. 'I.. I just want to go someplace where.. where I can make a long-distance phone call, and... and figure out what to do.'  Pobble looks less confused. Just a little. Silver tipped fingers fidget and to counteract this, they're sent on an errant into a pocket to pull out a crumpled pack of cigarettes. 'Look, kid.' begins Pobble evenly, 'How about we make a deal?' The tiny figure is back in the rear window of the hummer, just an outline. 'You tell me the truth, and I'll give you a phone and sort out anything you need to get yourself back on track?' He spreads his gloved palms openly, after popping a smoke between his lips and replacing the pack in pocket.  She rocks from foot to foot, and shakes her head tightly. 'You'd not believe the truth if I told you, sir... no disrespect or anything meant, but... ' Naoko smiles oddly, curiously, and then says, 'I'm not a kid. My name is Xenon.'  Pobble smirks at that, 'Well, I am Dr. Steve. You can call me Pobble if you like.' He sparks the cigarette, taking his time with the first inhalation. 'You'd be surpised at what I'd believe.' He smiles, but it's a serious smile. Cigarette is jutted out towards the invisible anomaly. 'You'd also be surprised to know that other people will probably have noticed that, and they're definately not as nice as me.'  'But... it...' She bites her lip again, and then forces a smile. 'They won't find anything. In less than two hours, it'll all have reduced itself to its base elements anyhow, and sunk down into the ground.'  Pobble shakes his head sadly, 'Just because something isn't there anymore, doesn't mean people can't see it.' The way he says this makes it sound obvious. Noting that he's maybe being harsh he manages a smile, trying to look reassuring. 'I'm no stranger to bizarre shit. Trust me. You should come clean though Xenon, I can help you. Honest like.'  She draws a deep breath. Her eyes roam skyward. She folds her hands at her waist. 'I'm from the future...' she breathes, letting those words hang in the air, all dramatic-like and everything. 'The future, Pobble.' She looks to you and waits to see what you have to say to that. PLease please don't take her to the loony bin.  The shocking revelation leaves the Doctor looking unphased. 'Right.' he says, much like someone would say 'Fair enough.'. He nods, taking another nicotine dose and flicking ash off to the side where it sticks to the wet yellow body of the hummer. 'How did you get here?' he asks, cigarette still between lips and waggling up and down as he talks.  Naoko shakes her head and draws back a little. 'You don't believe me.. do you?' she asks, with that same wide-eyed expression. 'I'm from the future. January 23, 1985,' she tries to explain, and then looks down at her hands. 'This is stupid. There's no way in hell you're going to believe me.' Though every word she says is completely earnest. This broad must be out of her gourd.  Pobble laughs, inappropriately. This causes the cigarette to fall from his lips and fizzle out in a puddle near his feet. No loss. Someone inside the vehicle laughs too, a higher pitched but muffled sound. 'I hate to break this to you,' Pobble says honestly, 'But 1985 is not quite the future.' Standing up for this long is causing him to become a little unsteady, and wobbling to the side he twists and resteadies himself on the bumper.  Naoko looks you over once again, and says with a certain amount of certainty, 'Sir,' and waves a hand over your clothing, 'Given your general apparel and demeanor, it is most evident that we are in the Vietnam-war protest era. Such people as you I studied in my American History classes.'  There is sniggering from within the SUV. Pobble rolls his eyes, 'Xenon.. When you were studying your American History classes, I was learning what fractions were.' He shakes his head, smiling crookedly. 'Also, being English I diddn't really give a fuck about the Vietnam war. I was too little to care about it.'  'What time is it then?' she asks, now further confused at it all. 'Funny. I thought... well, nevermind what I thought...' She regards you in a most curious fashion, and adds, 'I... I've had...a hell of a day. I apologize. I'm.. I'm having a bit of trouble with my reality today.'   PROVE: Naoko has the stat or ability echoes at or above level 2. OOC Naoko says, 'From that, and all that she's been through, timepieces malfunction terribly in her presence.'  Pobble pulls a phone from his pocket. It's a bizarre thing, like a borg cellphone that started out mini and then assimilated bits from other things to increase its size. It's wrapped in a cross of neon yellow tape and maked with strange patterns. He glances down at the screen and frowns. 'Bloody phone is screwy.' he mutters, and tries to think. 'It's may something, 2004. Night time.' He shrugs apologetically, 'Sorry I can't be more specific.' Naoko quirks her head to the side, and then her eyes nearly pop out of her head. She jumps, about a foot in the air, and smacks her hand against her forehead, causing the blue spikes in her hair to wobble. '2004!!!??' she squeals, surprised, delighted, confused, all at once. 'I have to get to a phone. Immediately! The future of the free world may well depend on it!'  Pobble offers the contraption in his hand. Although it may be unrecognizable as a phone. He smiles, perhaps at your enthusiasm. A whisper from the depths of the vehicle says, 'She's fucking crazy mate. Loony. Maybe she's.. y'know. One of them.'  She eyes the phone, and then goes 'Ahh! My father was working on one like this! Let's see... now... if I can... just...' Naoko sets the duffel bag down on the ground and unzips it. Dig dig dig. She finds this weird thing that's a tiny monitor with wires sticking out of it, and sets that on her lap. 'Red... red... blue goes with blue... yellow and yellow... ' The girl is now unwiring your telephone.  Pobble wrinkles his nose, looking uncomfortable at this. 'You should be careful with that. It ain't normal. Doesn't.. oh never mind. I can always patch up a new one. Don't fuck with it too much and it'll be a secure line.' He sighs, and the voice inside reiterates, 'Fruitloop.'  'Shh. I know what I'm doing.' The kid starts wiring the device into the phone, and then pulls a simple 9-volt battery out. She slaps that into the socket on the monitor, and flips a switch on the side. An eerie hum as it powers up.  Naoko rolls 3 (3 dice) at a difficulty of 5:  5 5 8 Achieving 3 successes, resulting in a complete success.  Pobble quirks a brow, which dissapears under the beanie. He doesn't look too suprised, but just leans there watching. Something moves in the open doorway, a tiny figure peering from the shadows. 'Whatcha doing then?' he asks quietly.  'Shh...' There's an image that forms on the screen, for a moment. A bunker, like an old army base, out in the middle of the desert. She taps a few buttons on the side of the monitor and it zooms in. Cobwebs. Dust. Broken beakers and destroyed machinery. There's a big big gaping hole where some large piece of machinery was ripped out, and only the cords and connections left. The whole compound looks like it was a battlefield. Her face falls... and falls.. and falls some more... and she flips the image off. 'Oh... my god... they've got it...'  Rising up on his toes, Pobble attempts to see what's on the screen better. The critter in the truck begins to creep out too, becomming visible in the backwash of the headlights. Dave Monkey clutches a cigar and the smoke trails up around him and back into the air conditioned vehicle. 'What?' they ask in unison, 'Something wrong?'  'The second prototype of the Tachyon Field Multiplexer... they took it... ' Whatever this is, this is BAD BAD BAD, judging from the expression on her face. 'The Russians...' she trails off, after stating the name of the most frightful boogeyman she can name.  Pobble half smiles despite the situation, 'The Russians aren't so bad anymore you know.' 'Right.' Agrees the monkey with the cigar. Pobble does look puzzled however, tapping his silver fingertips together with a hard almost metallic sound. 'I have no idea what that thing is though.. is eh, that what bought you back here?'  'But they have it... that's... that's... oh god, the future of the free world... THe Russians.. the bomb... Oh god... It's all so... so... bad... ' And that's enough stress for Naoko. The girl gets all flustered in her cheeks, and stumbles to the ground, planting her hand there so she doesn't completely bruise herself up. 'I need to eat. I haven't eaten in over two days...'  Dave Monkey scampers back into the SUV and returns with an opened jumbo bag of potato chips. They scatter about as he offers them across, from his perch up on the seat.   Pobble sighs, becomming confused and awkward once more. 'Look, kid. Lets get you out of here, in case anyone else comes along. We can get you settled and then figure out what we're going to do about it all..'  OOC Naoko says, 'can we say she fell asleep in the car? I need to go.'

the first thing visible where a ranger can be seen at all times manning the station and answering any question that may come up Smaller booths are set up as well selling various overpriced camping gear t-shirts as well as maps of the area Contents Naoko Obvious exits Gravel Road to Cabin GR South S East E North on Gabbi N It's night It's breezy out It's a bit chilly Of course the gal walking up the street seems to pay no heed to this She's wandering a bit confused stopping from time to time and looking at the sky When she does she holds some sort of weird-looking binoculars up to her eyes A frown and she shakes her head God Another five miles at LEAST Japanese accent English definately not the first language Naoko is looking at you The stillness of the night air is threatened by the sound of wet gravel being displaced from the road Halogen brights tear the darkness apart as a behemothic Hummer meanders into view The rain slick roads are no match for its traction but the driver doesn't seem to be the most competent swerving and meandering over the road for no apparent reason The vehicle slows as it nears the gates a window lowering to allow the crisp air to enter and consequently push out the stale noxious smoke from within the cabin The girl leaps and almost drops her binoculars catching them at the last minute Ohmigod A car She stuffs the binoculars in the large duffel bag at her side and goes running top speed for it waving her hands wildly WAIT WAIT she yells at the top of her lungs There is a crunching as brakes engage the SUV grinding to a halt just in front of the woman The interior is dark windows tinted Up close and out of the direct view of the blinding lights its easy to notice that the relatively new vehicle is banged up scratched and not in the best of states Smoke is exhaled through the open window and a tired voice calls out from within Awright there The girl gasps a bit out of breath and takes a moment to get her bearings Yes no I mean I guess so Uhh Hi Naoko smiles oddly I uh She stops and her eyes roam toward the sky Could I get a ride I I am kind of stuck Brilliant That's the first word that usually pops to one's lips upon looking at this spry teenager brilliant in her actions brilliant in her speech and my god brilliant in her appearance Wherever this girl goes she's always walking on sunshine First the basics She's young a teenager around or so years old The heritage is clearly Japanese for all of the features tell it true the warm shade of her skin the delicately sloped eyes of deep brown the pert and gentle nose China Girl at first glance one might think but unmistakably she's Japanese When she speaks her accent most certainly confirms the ethnicity while the times that she has to pause for her words confirms that English isn't her first language either A gal of small stature she's only about tall and can't weigh more than pounds dripping wet However she more than makes up for that with the bold manner with which she presents herself The jet black hair is cut short feathered in the front like a flock of seagulls and with an unhealthy amount of serious gel she wears it spiked in every which direction so that her silhouette looks like a starburst Furthermore the hair is streaked with vibrant electric blue adding color to the mix Her every action seems as if it were driven by a live current with the setting cranked all the way up to hyper-manic The future's so bright you gotta wear shades and the same is true for her clothing She's dressed like she's ready to party like it's A white ringer t-shirt with the Pac-Man logo on it and the words Pac-Man Fever is worn across her chest decorated with red rings at the neck and sleeves Over that she wears a screaming neon yellow shirt patterned with aqua blue swooshes that look like they were streaked on with quick strokes of a paintbrush The skirt she wears is a bold black-and-white checkerboard pattern and it flares out from her hips reaching down to a few inches above her knee Looking lower she's got matching yellow leg warmers pulled up to her knees and stopping just above a pair of very retro-looking Keds white with neon pink stripes and neon pink shoelaces The accessorizing is mostly in neon pink from the Swatch Watch on her wrist that tells the time with artistically crooked hands over a light-up face complete with a clear pink jelly-style wristband to the giant neon pink plastic hoops that dangle from her earlobes On each wrist is no less than jelly bracelets in a rainbow of colors intermixed with a few hand-woven friendship bands Finally the outfit is completed by blinding you with,296,test
187,187,1151815,1,25,"       Here's the log. It's missing a pose from me, I think, near the beginning. Pardon the bad posing and etc. We really had to rush it cuz I had to bail soon :P  You enter the shop.  Queen of Wands - Main Shop(#6966RlJ) This shop seems to fall somewhere in between small and large in the scale of size, though it can be hard to get a feel for just how big, or small, it actually is. The layout is a bit haphazard, with little twists and turns created by the setup of the shelves, resulting in little nooks in unexpected places. Upon these shelves is a variety of wares to suit the pagan shopper. Near the front is a selection of jewelry, as well as some of the higher priced ritual equipment, such as wands and athames, all kept behind a locked glass counter. Lining the walls are myriad shelves containing books, organized into sections such as 'Goddess Worship', 'Celtic', 'Psychic Arts', 'Divination' and 'Native Arts'. The books range in quality from the serious, to obvious fluff.. something to suit all tastes. There are the old standbys such as 'Dancing the Circle' and 'Drawing Down The Moon', as well as your usual horde of Llewellyn books. The rest of the shelves contain what seems to be a constantly changing selection of goods, though things such as tarot decks, stones, herbs, and candles are a constant ware. The air within the shop is constantly scented with mild incense, and music plays in the background, often music over the sound of waterfalls or rain. In the back is a door, with a sign posted listing times when psychic readings and holistic medicinal services are available. The shop is lit with discreetly placed track lighting, with the addition of tiny white bulbs dotting the ceiling. If one knows anything about astronomy, it's easy to tell that the stars are in the form of the constellations, and is very well done, with everything in it's proper place. Looking out the plate glass window that overlooks the street, you see it's clear, cool, and breezy..  Contents: Jake Daisy  //.etro: Escalus will be joining your location. Escalus has arrived.  The warning bell rings a good three seconds before Jake pushes open the door and walks in, closely followed by Hiro, it appears.  Cadence enters from the street. Cadence has arrived.  Suddenly, one of Hiro's phone rings.   Escalus says 'phones.'  Hiro was loitering outside; now, suddenly, he is inside - having slipped in alongside Jake. 'Yo,' he grunts-more-than-says; swinging his courier bag around to rifle through the interior. He comes up with a cheap, blocky cellphone -- the prepaid variety that doesn't require credit checks, background checks, or using your real name. 'Yoallo?' he asks, thumbing 'ok' and lifting the phone to his ear. >> 'Hello? Hello? Please don't hang up. My name is Dana Acheson.'  Cadence heads into the shop, expecting few if any people around. She carries a book and newspapers under one arm, her backpack over her shoulders. From long habit she turns toward the front counter and starts that way before even looking around. She stops short, just before almost running over Jake and Hiro ahead of her. 'Whoa.'  To Daisy, the activity she's participating in right now -- leaning sullenly against a wall, aviator sunglasses pushed up to blot out every last photon, is 'hanging out'. To local storeowners and the municipal police, this activity is called 'illegal loitering'.  '...yeah, right, who gave you this number, huh?' Hiro asks his phone, twisting in place to eye Cadence sidelong. He steps aside, expression irritable -- as if Cadence has no right to be here -- and slouches over alongside Daisy.  Jake pulls his sunglasses down to the end of his nose and looks over them as he walks around towards the back of the store. When Cadence comes in, he turns and smiles, 'Cade... how you doing?'  >> 'Dr. Maximillian Ravenhurst told me I should get in touch with you, but I find the number by . . . adjustment.'  Cadence gives Hiro an amused glace as she continues on her way to the counter setting her things down on the edge before hopping up onto her favorite seat. She grins over at Jake, 'Good to see you! I see you've found a new sense of style.'  Hiro tilts the phone aside, mouthing 'Ravenhurst' in Daisy's direction; expression quizzical. The mic maneuvers back into place. 'Yeah, you looking for Peachy K or sommat? I got his number, but he's been kinda busy..'  Daisy doesn't flinch at Hiro's telephone conversation -- -- but you can see the tendons in her neck vibrate with anxiety, and a wave of tension pass across her shoulders, across her back, and down her arms, where it's finally released in a wave of antsy knuckle-cracking. This is not a girl who deals well with unexpected circumstances.  >> 'I am looking for Mr. Keene or his colleagues. I need to talk to one of them.'  Jake notices no tendons as he walks back over to Cadence, 'Huh?' He looks down at himself, 'Oh. Ted recommended it. It covered up the vest nicely.' He looks up, 'Something about a red pill and following a white rabbit. I didn't quite follow him. But this is apparently very universal if you need to more around alot.  Cadence smiles at him, nodding. 'It works,' she agrees. She keeps her voice down so as not to disturb Hiro's phone conversation across the room, idling swinging one leg back and forth in her position on the countertop. 'You're getting to be buddies with Ted, then?'  '...yeah well you got his colleague. This' Stice.' Hiro's voice remains super-cool. His expression has waned into outright panic. 'Is there uh something I can help you with?'  Jake shrugs, 'I... honestly don't know. Ever get the feeling everything you knew was wrong?'  >> 'Yes. Would you care to meet me? I know you have no reason to trust me, but I can only say that . . . there are important things than this war.'  Cadence nods to Jake. 'All the time,' she murmurs to him softly. 'It's a horrible feeling.' she offers Jake her hand, but her attention has now strayed to Hiro and his terrified phone conversation.  'Dude,' the young punk girl stage-whispers, peering at Hiro over the gold frames of her aviator glasses, 'use your ... whazzitcalled ... craft name. They eat that shit up. And ask him about my petition.'  'Yeah well considering I've never heard your name before, yeah.' Paradoxically, Hiro abrubtly seems significantly calmer. He isn't in trouble. 'I'll meet you somewhere. Is there some kind of problem or summat? You got my attention with the name-dropping, but...'  Hiro hits mute. 'Ain' him. Some dude,' he tells Daisy, thumbing the button a second time.  >> 'You can certainly say there is a problem. There is a wrong that must be righted.'  Jake leans against the counter, 'I'm trying to figure out what's the truth of the matter... and the deeper I look, the worse it looks.' He sighs.  'I know,' Cadence agrees quietly. 'I had half hoped you wouldn't look. I enjoyed your optimism.'  'Yeah well no specifics onna phone, right? Where an' when?' Hiro asks the phone, gesturing at Daisy for a cigarette.  Jake nods a bit, 'Optimism based on lies does not a good reality make, I'm afraid.'  Cadence half watches Hiro and Daisy out of the corner of her eye, but replies to Jake, 'I know. I should have spoken with you about it more. I apologize.'  GPCs, a crushed pack, emerge from the pocket of her pants. Daisy offers the entire thing to Hiro, and doesn't take one herself. Her expression is a perfect mirror of Hiro's.  >> 'I am the one asking, so I will let you set the tone. I'll be alone. None of my people will be there.'  Jake makes a dismissive hand gesture to Cadence, 'Oh, Pish Posh. You've done wonders for me.'  Cadence insists, 'I could have done more. I should have.' She makes a face, and is silent a moment, but suddenly says, 'I do have a little bit of good news. Some hope, I guess, or at least an idea.'Hiro pins his phone between ear and shoulder, shaking out a cigarette. 'I don't like the sound of that, man,' he murmurs around the smoke fitted between his lips. The pack dissapears into a pocket; a flash of butane flares between cupped hands. 'But you can find this, you can find me...' He trails off, voice dropping significantly in volume when he continues.  Jake perks up a bit, 'Oh?'  Cadence leans in and whispers to Jake quietly, motioning with one hand toward the newspapers on the counter next to her.  >> 'Actually, I cannot. I have no skill in spatial science; this is on purpose. I randomly dialed the right number.'  You paged Escalus with 'There's a starbucks at the corner of ... in downtown Toronto. It's high-profile and public. We'll be there in five minutes. If you aren't, meeting's off. You seem like a lucky guy. Catch a lucky cab.'.  Jake nods to Cadence, 'Well good for him!'  Daisy now thumbs at the corner of her mouth, disguising an expression that is rapidly becoming even sourer than Hiro's. A glance is cast back to Jake and Cadence, then back to Hiro again.  Cadence nods to Jake, 'Exactly. Obvious, but good news. Feel like helping?'  'Come on, Daisy. We gotta go,' murmurs Hiro, dropping the phone into his hand, and thumbing 'off'. He hooks a thumbnail into the phone's release, strips away the faceplate, battery, screen, extracts a chip from the center, and leans over the counter to deposit the mess of gutted phone into the trash bin. A flashed 'peace' in Cadence's direction, and he heads for the exit; bending the chip between his fingers to weaken the silicon.  Cadence waves to Hiro in reply.  Jake nods to cadence, 'Certainly.'  To Cadence, Daisy gives a single explicit instruction. 'Burn that,' she says flatly, turning to join Hiro on his way out. One hand brushes through her hair; the other grasps nervously at the laser pointer held in her center hoodie pocket.  You leave the shop.  [...] Travel through the city, to Starbucks - 2 blocks away [...]  The rich aroma from Starbucks draws you in.  Starbucks(#547RJM)      In the fashion of all Starbucks, this coffee house is styled after the Italian coffee bars where regulars sit at small table and booths and drink espresso with their friends. It provides a seductive atmosphere, sleek yet comfortable. The coffee preparers, known as 'baristas', Italian for bartender, are busy behind the counter preparing various caffeine filled beverages. The aroma of their creations teases your senses. The counter and the entire room feature plenty of burnished wood and brass. About the place sophisticated artwork hangs on the walls. The sound of soft-rock music can be heard over the continuous murmur of the patrons. Through the front window pedestrians can be seen, glancing back at you as the aroma coming through the front door distracts them.                          -- Places Available Here --   Obvious exits: Out     Daisy comes in off the street following the rich aroma of coffee. Daisy has arrived.  Hiro tugs the door open, wedging it open with his elbow to allow Daisy to follow behind him. He drops a handful of some crumbly green substance -- some kind of broken plastic, perhaps -- in the trash next to the entrance; brushing his hands together as he surveys the place. 'Next to the window,' he instructs Daisy.  Jesse's invisble friend has tagged along on this Invisible outing. Although his contact to the skinlands is AWOL tonight, he couldn't resist tagging along as the chaos that follows is always entertaining.  'Better switch out all the phones,' suggests Hiro's partner in crime, 'just as soon as you can. Better do it another place, though, on account of paying in quarters twice might be a tad suspicious.' The barrista is watching her suspiciously. Apparently, Daisy's past excursions to Starbucks have gone unsurprisingly badly.  At this time of the morning there is only one person in Starbucks. He's a sandy-haired business-suit wearing man wearing silver-rimmed round spectacles. He's got a John Lennon-y look to him.  They're a feeble disguise, those glasses are, but Daisy still pushes them up as she enters. Better to have a shield against prying eyes, satellites, and god-knows-what-else than to go naked. So, having just snorted a bump of powdered confidence from the hollow of her thumbnail, Daisy struts on across the Starbucks toward Lennon. 'You the guy we're waiting for?', she asks.  'I am Dana Acheson, if that is the man you are looking for.' He speaks calmly and clearly. 'Thank you for meeting me like this. You are friends of Keene?'  Hiro, taking his own advice, seats himself by the window; turning his head to watch the interaction between Daisy and Mr. Lennon. He doesn't say anything further, merely slouching in his seat.  Acheson shifts a little bit in his seat. It is the only sign of his discomfort.  At your table D'My name's Daisy. Daisy Inscrutable. So don't bother lookin' it up, 'cause it's obviously ain't my real name.'  Daisy smiles thinly. It's a carefully rationed expression, neither friendly nor unfriendly, neither open nor closed. 'And yeah. We know Keene.''  At your table Acheson nods. 'We have a saying in the Syndicate, Daisy. Everything's got a price. I need to find out what it will take for you and your friends to help me.'  At your table Hiro's hands fidget beneath the table; fingers lacing and unlacing. Finally, a hand rises with a cigarette -- procured from a labcoat pocket -- which he fits between his lips. He doesn't light it. 'You're talking. We're listening. Some things not even you can afford, man.'  At your table Acheson places his hands flat on the table, a gesture much like poker players use to show that they are ready to begin. 'I have already made quite an investment. I am meeting with you, without the Administrator of Toronto knowing about it. This could be construed as treason in some circles, even though it isn't. I need the help of your cabal . . . and just your cabal.'  At your table Hiro keeps his eye on the street as he speaks, watching the occasional car cruise past outside. Probably on the lookout for black sedans. 'You haven't said what you want, yet,' he points out, quietly.  At your table Acheson says 'It's usually not a good idea to lay all your cards on the table. This thing has the potential of blowing way the fuck out of proportion and taking a lot of people with it.' He takes out his own cigarette case--silver--and pulls rather expensive cigarillos out of it. He takes the time to light his cigar. 'I am still gauging you.''  At your table 'You're playin' around, man.' Hiro comes up with a cheap plastic bic; roasting the tip of his cigarette -- a cheap GPC -- to life. He makes no special effort to smoke it; letting it smoulder silently in the corner of his mouth. He seems adverse to eye contact - keeping his attention on the street. 'What we're doing here could be construed as treason, no matter who's name you waved like a white flag. So we're traitors. We've been called worse, you're prolly a squeaky clean fucker. What do you want?'  At your table Acheson says 'I want you to help me rid the world of a particularly vile contagion. We all do things that we are ashamed of, even organizations dedicated to the betterment of humanity like ours. This . . . thing . . . I need your help with, is one of the Union's darkest hours.''  Acheson taps his hand on the table, and you can hear the ring he is wearing clicking on it.  At your table and that, that gets Hiro's attention. He looks over; fixes his attention wordlessly on Acheson. 'Don't spook on me, aiight?' Unzipped outside pocket on his courier bag -- now hanging at his side -- and he rifles for something.  Hiro unzips his bag, rooting through it, and comes up with a battered black tape recorder. He hits play and reverse; setting it on the edge of the table.  At your table Acheson says 'How familiar are you with Bergen-Belsen?'  Acheson freezes as you put the tape recorded on the table. '/No/ recordings.'  At your table 'I ain't recording shit, man. Taking a precaution you should have taken, and I was too blasted to think of.' A thumbnail edges up the volume; it's definitely playing, not recording. Some kind of backwards nonsense interspersed with a murmur of static. 'Never heard of it. It's some front, I'm assuming.'  At your table Powdered confidence has crossed the line into anxiety and from there into paranoia. The expression on her face is locked into isostasis, lips pressed tremblingly hard against each other. Both of her hands are locked around the laser pointer in her front pocket. 'They buried something there,' she says, 'in a block of concrete, on account of it wouldn't die. The doctor who did it was Dutch something. Maybe from South Africa. It killed almost the entire unit before they put it down. It's still there. Eva told me about it.''  At your table Acheson says 'Bergen-Belsen was a concentration camp during the Second World War. It was part of the Final Solution.' He raises his eyebrows at Daisy's statement. 'I do not know anything about that. I do know that the Construct located there hosted Dr. Rudolph Zauberman and his pet nightmare, Projekt Ubermensch.''  At your table 'Yeah so maybe I wasn't paying attention during Hitler week in school.' Hiro's cigarette tilts upwards, the cherry's tip flaring. Smoke leaks from his mouth. 'So what happened?'  At your table Daisy bobs her head. Once. It's obviously forced, but it's the most she can muster.  At your table Acheson says 'After the second world war, when those of us who were called on the carpet for profiting from that madman's reign, they slapped Zauberman on the wrist and sent him to Eden.'  At your table Acheson says 'You see, no matter how tainted the source data, Ubermensch had very promising results.' Sarcasm is evident here. 'And success, to some, is more important than ethics.'  At your table 'Don't you guys have internal people to deal with this kind of mess?' asks Hiro, ashing his cigarette off to one side.  At your table Acheson says 'You mean the Men In White? Yes, we do. But whenever you have an organization, you have politics, and there are people on the Amalgam Prime willing to overlook where the Ubermensch Data came from as long as the project continued to produce. No Man In White will go against an Amalgam Prime Ruling.' He takes a deep inhalation of his cigarillo. 'But we are not all Men In White.''  At your table 'Yeah, you aren't the only one with that kinda problem,' deadpans Hiro, scrutinizing the tip of his cigarette. 'So what happened? And why'd it hit Toronto?'  At your table Acheson says 'We . . . our conspiracy, if you want to call it that . . . have managed to . . . terminate all the remaining research members of Projekt Ubermensch, including Dr. Zauberman. We've managed to destroy all the data, even that data stored in the Central Archive, which is no small feat. There is only one last instance of Ubermensch left--one last link before it is gone forever.'  At your table Hiro says 'Tell you the truth, man, this sounds like it's a little over our heads. But what is it? This have something to do with the crazy shit that hit the streets this week?'  At your table Acheson says 'It isn't over your heads. It is right up your ally. We've tried three times to eliminate this last remaining piece, and we've failed three times. By now, FCA7-T and Palmerton must have figured out that it is an internal conspiracy. Therefore, the chance of us actually succeeding is virtually nil. However . . . they may not suspect an attack from a different direction.'  At your table 'We gotta speak with the others. You understand that. If you can give me a voicemail drop I can leave our decision at...' Hiro trails off, crushing his half-smoked GPC out on the table. 'We won't turn it over, even if we decide to assist, you understand. If we find it -- and I think I have an idea what you're referring to -- we'll want to destroy it.'  At your table Acheson inhales the smoke. 'You cannot share this with the rest of the Traditions here. We have enough data--the Man In White in charge of Toronto keeps careful eyes on you people. We're willing to give you more information, if necessary, to get you to do this.  At your table 'I mean -our- decision. Not their decision.' Hiro pushes his chair back, getting to his feet. 'We don't answer to the locals, man. They're a bunch of fuckin jerk-offs. We'll be in touch, right?'  Acheson says, 'Sure. Here is my number. I'll be in town.'

Within the Shadowlands the terrain is even more bleak as it's tainted with the effects of Oblivion. Through the streets, dreary looking Quick travel as through burdened by the weight of the world on their backs.  The occasional car passes down the road, when a loud banging sound is heard and echoes through the Shadowlands from somewhere just around the corner.  Imogen pages: I believe I will have to page you with what you see, I regret the inconvenience. :( I will soon create a command that will make all this flow more easily.)  Imogen pages: The effects of what's about to occur will happen in the Skinlands You paged Imogen with 'Ah!'. Long distance to Imogen: Penny sits tight, then. Imogen pages: Any chance you saw that last pose? You paged Imogen with 'Nope.'.  Imogen pages: The twilight air of Toronto heralds with it a light rain. The city street is mostly vacant except the occasional passing car. One such vehicle begins to come near the intersection in which you stand. The driver looks awake, but exhausted from a typical day at work.  You paged Imogen with 'Should I pose outloud or to you..'. Imogen pages: Please pose outloud.

Pressing back into it, she strikes a match and watches the people start to scatter off; catching buses, hailing cabs and pooling themselves into the subways.  Imogen pages: Mere seconds later, the vehicle is lurched into chaos. The driver flings his arms around wildly as though suffering horrible hallucinations or just basically 'freaking out'. The tires squeal and the car arches hard off the street proper to barrel down the sidewalk. 4 Pedestrians who turn startled by the sound shriek in terror as the car rolls quickly towards them.

Imogen pages: I believe it's an Arete roll vs 6.   Long distance to Imogen: Penny nods. //.etro: Penny rolls 'arete' privately to Imogen at diff 6. For a total of 3 success(es).  Imogen pages: Some of the people are too slow, and they are caught under the wheels of the out of control car and it's lunatic driver. Moments after running down 2 of them the car collides with a light pole standing near to the road. The red spray of crimson mist splatters along the windshield and steering wheel. Cries announce from those nearby and some of the patrons of nearby establishments rush out from the noise to find out what's going on.  Imogen pages: The spirit detects nothing unnatural going on nearby. If anything is going on, it's within a realm that the spirit cannot sense. You paged Imogen with 'Excellent.'.  Penny drags hard, exhales harder and keeps frozen inside the doorway. It's true what they say about carwrecks - you just can't turn away. Her gaze travels from the mowed down people to the car to the lightpole. Caught there, she yells at people emerging from doors and windows, presumably with a lot of other voices 'Don't! That's a live wire! Get back!' murmuring to herself something mean and subtle about dumb frogs, lurching from the recess suddenly to turn to those nearby 'GET BACK.'  Imogen pages: Individuals are smart, but peoplethey're stupid. Luckily the morbid nature of most of the population tends to make them all observers rather than to actually get involved when something horrific is occurring around them. So most just circle around the car gawking at the pleasant red color trickling down the car's glass. Some raise their hands to cover their mouths but at least one of them has the common sense to grab a phone.  OOC Imogen says 'Pending on Penny, I believe' Takoda arrives from the north. Takoda has arrived.  Penny looks at her phone once, then up to the accident and tucks it back to that inner pocket of her jacket. Who would she call? She looks out at the crowd again and shuffles people behind her with an assertiveness of an old hand; crowd control doesn't come naturally but who'll argue with a shaved woman? That's right - not these nice, normal people. Herded away, some cry at the horror and happenstance of it all. When questioned later some may say 'He just came out of nowhere,' and 'I was just leaving work' - they rehearse these things among themselves as Penny leaves them, against better judgement, to get a better look at the plates of the car. Or something.  //.etro: Imogen rolls '4' at diff 6 For a total of 3 success(es).  Lights. Red and Blue and White and Yellow: That's the first thing that comes to view. And then a Forest green SUV comes barrelling down the road, slowing as it approaches what looks to be... Well, a mess. Slowing down, so as not to hurt another pedestrian, the SUV, with the White Stenciled letters, 'Parn Warden' stops a number of yards from the actual accident. The vehicle is turned off, but the lights remain flashing, and out steps Takoda. 'Fuck.' He mutters to himself, before he states, while exiting the car, over the Dispatch channel, 'This is officer Wanikiya arriving on scene, requesting immediate Emergancy aid and backup. We've got a crowd.'  //.etro: Imogen rolls '3' at diff 5 For a total of 1 success(es).  EMS Units sound their sirens down the street. The echo of the wail reverberates through the buildings accompanied shortly afterwards by the police.  Well of course there's a crowd. It's rush hour, there's dead people on the pavement and no cops in sight .. except the park ranger.  Penny looks around for other gawkers to blend with, catches the tail end of some Eaton Center shopper-crowd and walks with them. She talks quietly with one of the tourists, pointing at her camera. The pantomime under the noise could be read a few ways; either she wants Penny to take a picture of her or is giving the camera to Penny.  Takoda finishes his statement, before he jogs over to the first of the downed pedestrians. 'Everybody please stay back.' He shouts, as people draw closer, and he bends down to check the person's pulse. His movements belay a certain grace, a comfort in his own body that few people manage to achieve. Any sign of authority is 'something' and the flashing lights of his SUV appear to give Takoda some authority. Most of the pedestrians move back, but remain within eyeshot.  The order in the area is, of course, objective. Any kind of Canadian crowd'll have it's hecklers and it's shriekers; it's weeping and its morbidly curious. In this burgeoning, Penny focuses the polaroid on the car, snaps off one shot, then hands it back to the sweaty-palmed tourist with another brief exchange. Thank-yous, some might opine and be right. She pockets the picture before it develops and edges around the crowd. The question on everyone's lips is 'Is the driver still alive?'  //.etro: Jeff rolls for Initiative: wits + dex + 1d10 -> 11 Tex arrives from the north. Tex has arrived. //.etro: Imogen rolls '8' at diff 6 For a total of 1 success(es).  More sirens wail in the distance, but one squad car screeches to a sudden halt as it approaches the scene. The crowd of onlookers earns a scowl from Tex, as he steps from his awkwardly parked car. He approaches the wrecked vehicle and the crowd, taking his badge out, and tucking it in his coat pocket to identify him as a officer.  OOC Penny says 'It's Takoda's pose, yeah?' OOC Takoda says 'Yes, I was waiting on something.:)' //.etro: Imogen rolls '2' at diff 6 For a total of 1 success(es) including 1 ten(s).    Tom has arrived. Tom goes back IC.  Takoda steps up from the first person on the sidewalk, seeming to be content with the heartbeat of that individual. The second one gets a glance, as the woman moans. 'Don't worry Ma'am, EMT's are on their way.' He says closer to her, bending down for a moment to examine her, before he finally moves to the car. He whips out a flashlight, and shines it inside to take another quick one over, reaching inside to place his fingers on the driver's neck. Again, he nods, and steps back, glancing over as Tex arrives, speaking into his walkie-talkie on his shoulder. 'This is officer Wanikiya, I have two wounded, another critically. Please send additional EMT assistance.'  Wool coat tossed loosely over his shoulders, Tom seems to be exiting from the Liquor Store, a little unawares of the whole situation. Perhaps a slight fog - narcotic or alcoholic or just the moisture in the air acting on his sinuses - acts on his senses. Regardless, he looks slightly dazed by the scene of disorder that confronts him once he's exited the store. In a mild state of shock, he hefts up the brown paper bag full of clanking beer bottles he has gathered into one arm. Numbly, he wanders a half-circle, eyes not failing to notice the spray of blood across the front windshield. Mouth half-opens, releases a semi-conscious, 'Jesus... fucking... downright awful.'  Tex peers at the vehicle, to see if he can spot any gas leaking from vehicle. Fluids are everywhere...no telling if petrol is involved. Turning to the crowd of onlookers, who carefully approach the accident scene. 'Get back!' he barks to the people, stalking towards them like a predator. 'Get the hell back!' he barks again. His attitude and tone of voice suggest he'll brook no mischief from anyone.  Penny keeps looking up, waiting for the damaged light pole to fall. Penny, pending doom. She drops back another few feet, bumping into people when the officer raises his voice. She keeps her head down, reaching behind her neck, tugging out the hooded part to cover up. 'Is he? Did they say?' someone on a cellphone keeps asking Penny - like she's some authority on who lives and dies in the street. 'Look, I dunno. Ask that guy, he's the cop yeah?' nodding over to Tex.  Takoda read your description.  Takoda looks over to Tex, nodding to the man in gratitude, before he leans back down again, into the car. 'Sir, sir, can you hear me? Emergancy services are on their way sir, you're gonna be alright...' He meanwhile shines his flashlight around inside the car, looking for any passangers, or any signs of mischief.  The driver appears to have lost consciousness. Trauma to the head from impact with the Steering wheel then the glass Obviously not wearing his seat belt correctly.  As Tex barks at the crowd, Tom dutifully withdraws. Either shame or common sense (or, perhaps, both) prevails in getting him to take his eyes away from the whole reprehensible, compelling, disheartening scene. He paces the outskirts of the crowd, hugging foreign beers to his chest, scanning the faces of his fellow onlookers, eyes burning, alight; a penetrating gaze.  Tex reaches into his pocket, and produces a set of car keys. 'Don't get any closer!' he tells the crowd in a gravel-scratch voice. He runs to the trunk of his car, and opens it. He rummages around inside, and produces a duffel kit, and the typical roll of yellow tape. He runs back to the crowd to ensure that his orders were complied with. 'Officer, don't let that guys head move. Keep tabs on his pulse.' he asks the man. He drops the duffel bag, and finds a mailbox to tie some tape off too. 'And get a E.T.A. on our medical.' he says. He has a feeling that the driver dosen't have very long.  The lights of the Ambulance herald in the EMS. It's approach is slow, yes but here it is. Once it grinds to a halt 3 Emergency technicians exit carrying their gurney and move quickly to the site of the crash.  'Gotchya.' Takoda states, making sure to make no sudden movements near the man's head. It's rather obvious he isn't quite used to this sort of situation, but seems to be handling it just fine. 'ETA is any minute...' His voice trails off as the ambulance arrives. When the EMT's begin to head over, he steps back from the vehicle, glancing down at his bloodied hand, from checking the driver's pulse.  Penny turns a shoulder to the scene when the ambulance finally arrives, its sirens heralding help. Seems to be an effective way to get people moving again, restoring order to the momentarily paralysis of the commuting public. She shudders, touching her way through the pedestrians, kindling side-to-side glances; who touched me? what was that? was that you? No it wasn't; just Penny in wake, shaking out the polaroid.  Imogen pages: That still will be probably worth some money with the local newspaper. :) Imogen pages: still=photo, whatever. :) Long distance to Imogen: Penny images it would be. What's it show us? Imogen pages: When did you take it? Long distance to Imogen: Penny scrolls up. You paged Imogen with 'Right before Jeff's roll. And exactly before Tex arrived.'.   Jaw squared off, Tom's pale eyes twist away from the crowd. There's something in the reflections on their eyes he doesn't like to look at. The blood - or maybe the strange, gaping sort of hunger. If not for blood, than for information, than for a story to watch. A generation of people grown up on car chases and wrecks in the movies now avidly consuming real life as though it were entertainment. As though it were sold to them, and they were buying. An easy walk carries him away from the scene, towards his car, parked an alarmingly close distance away. Moistening his dry bottom lip, he struggles to keep his legs still, keep the tremble out until he's safe in his car and on the road.  One Emergency care technician exits the van and moves to Tex to find out the details of the situation. The 3 that exited earlier divide and each attends one of the fallen victims of the accident. One to each person that was run over, then another to the driver. Once there he says to Takoda, 'Thank you sir, I have it from here.'  A yellow barricade of tape is erected slowly, with room left for EMT's to do their job. Tex runs the tape along his own pre-set path, moving pedestrians and traffic out of his way rather roughly, if they do not comply. A few zig-zags later, he ties off the tape and a established accident scene is created. That being done, he lets the EMTs do thier job, and he can really begin his. A notepad and pencil are pulled from his coat. 'Who can tell me what happened here? Did anyone see the accident?' he barks out to the crowd of onlookers. Someone here saw what happened, he's sure.  Takoda seems again, relieved that the EMT has taken over. He steps back from the car, clicking his flashlight off, slipping it into a small clot on his belt. Clicking the pouch closed, he glances about once more, before he heads slowly towards his SUV, parked just outside of the Police yellow tape. his Red and blue flashing lights still do their thing, and he leans into the open driver's side door to remove a small white metal box. Opening it, he pull sout some sterile towels, and a bottle of disinfectant, and goes to work on his hand.   Imogen pages: Lets see, within the SKinlands you coudl have gotten a picture  of whatever you like. :) Should anything 'special' be done with the photo so see other realms I've noted what would be on the still.  //.etro: Imogen rolls '8' at diff 4 For a total of 7 success(es) including 2 ten(s). //.etro: Imogen rolls '1' at diff 2 For a total of 1 success(es).

Order is established, or at least to the satisfaction of Tex. He starts taking statments from the witnesses to the accident. The EMT is privy to what's being said, to avoid any confusion. And to save Tex the time of having to re-tell the same story.  Imogen pages: Anything for me?  With the beer secure in the passenger seat, Tom pulls on his safety belt. Makes sure the damn thing is extra tight, adjusted correctly, his seat isn't loose, the steering column is tilted to best prevent injury... once he's satisified that his mirrors are in a state of relative symmetry, he starts the car and begins to pull away. Pressing the play button on his CD player, he tries to sink into the relaxing sounds of a Phil Collins CD that came with the car. As he mouths the words to Su-su-sudio, he does his best to put the whole awful event out of mind.

204,204,1234212,1,27,"       Ummm what was that previous post? I sure as hell don't know. I was punchy this morning...but I don't think I was that bad off....oh dear baby jesus fetus....  I wanna say this...I love C-Span...I mean it really is a national treasure that unfortunately most people don't know about...or really know what it is. Find it on your cable dial...and watch it sometime. You will find that it really is the only 'free' speech out there...it is unscripted...no news anchors...instead you get a feed from the House or the Senate...or you get a taping of a national book club meeting...no topic to dull for them to cover...their motto should be 'More information than we know what to do with'...or...'Need a nap...don't watch us...cause we're interesting'.  Ok well its not like that, but the channels cover so much.  Tonight I watched on C-Span1 a debate that was held on Oct. 25, 2003 at Regent University...the topic 'Constitutional Judicial Activism'.  The panelists ranged from well qualified to downright insipid. Here was the lineup.   Nadine Strossen - ALCU President Barry Lynn - Americans United for the Seperation of Church & State. Executive Director. Alan Dershowitz - Havard Law Proffessor Jay Sekulow - American Center for Law & Justice Chief Counsil David Limbaugh - Writer, pundit, retard Ann Coulter - Writer (HA!), pundit (Double HA!), whore, retard, skeletor, slut, bitch, cuntrag, oh what else...uneducated talking head.  Ok...so now that we have introduced out cast of characters (some woman from CourtTV was the moderator...no it wasn't that other cunt that is on Larry King Live all the time...she is a bitch of another caliber) let us get down to brass tax here.  Basically the debate was over whether or not the Supreme Court has been meddling in politics and taking political stances and not necesarilly legal views. Well the answer to this is really loaded...and it all depends on which side of the fence you sit on with a particular issue.   Take for instance abortion. The constitution (and I have to give the conservatives a little credit on this one) says nothing about it. It doesn't protect nor deny it...it just never mentions it...probably because it was before it really was an issue.  The argument on the side of the conservative now (it has changed so many times from murder, to morally wrong, to plain out religious hatred) is that the Judges should never have ruled on Roe v Wade in the first place because the court (which I happen to agree with) is only supposed to rule or even hear constitutional arguments...in other words it is only there for the constitution and nothing else. I agree with that.  However in the case of Roe v. Wade it was a constitutional issue as it was framed in a lawsuit because it specifically challenged a state law that limited private choice and freedom. To me that is simple. The court did need to weigh in on the issue.   By the way...if you want to know. I am PRO CHOICE!!!! It is in line with my beliefs very easily...and here is why. We all have the choice to do good or bad. I personally wouldn't have an abortion if I was a female...but I am not so I don't have to make the choice...but that does not mean that I should be able to impose my morals or views on someone as long as their activity is not directly harming my person or property. I can think that it is disgusting and horrible...but that doesn't mean that I can puch that view on someone else. I would just hope that they would see it as that. In my eyes...do whatever you want just don't impose it on me.  I took a few notes of this debate...it really was sad to see that the people in that place were actually applauding the retards on the right. I call them that because they are indeed morally and socially retarded. It would seem that they would love to live under a system that really doesn't give them even the choice of what they want for dinner...because to argue against the seperation of church and state (which they all were arguing that they should be combined!!!!) is really to argue for a system that has been proven time and time again to fail. So to argue this point...or from this side is indeed retarded. Like sticking your hand back into the fire five minutes after you stuck it in before and got burned.  David Limbaugh...who the fuck is he? I dunno...but I will say this. He is about as smart as horseshit in your refrigerator. He actually argued that the congress should limit the Supreme Court under Article 3 of the constitution. I looked and I sure couldn't find any limiting factors there. Actually it affirms that the court is pretty much above the fray of political shit that floats in our bowl of democracy.  He argues that (what in reality has been a mostly conservative president appointed panel) the court is very liberal. They are out of hand and need to be replaced.  I dunno...but I think this guy needs to have some sense beaten into him.  Jay Sekulow. He is a piece of work I tell ya. Imagine what a failed televangilist looks like. The hair, plastic skin look, tanned, with a bad almost pimp suit on. Umm yeah. That is this dude. He stated that President Bush is 'the comander and chief of the constitution'. What? I literally shook my head at that. I really don't know what that means. It was probably one of the dumbest things I have heard...almost like 'if it hadn't have been for my horse I wouldn't have made it through college that year.' A famous Louis Black joke...about anuerisms and how they are caused...  This guy is a walking anuerism. I can't think of one thing intelligent coming out of this dude. Really he just didn't make sense. He would say something one way and then turn it around and completely disprove his prior statement only a few minutes later.   Ann Coulter is the argument for abortion...ow my chest got a little pain on that one...I guess I do have some sort of soul...and I ripped a little of it out for that one.   I have seen her on CNN, Fox, ABC, CBS, NBC, now C-Span...she is a living, breathing, barely intelligible, cave woman. What she argues for...the positions that she takes would literally take women back to being nothing more that walking wombs...they would have no rights...hell under her ideals she wouldn't even exist. I can not honestly understand how she can be such a walking talking conflict...  Not only does she flat out lie...Read Al Frankens book and he actually has the good ones on her...but she is also not that intelligent. Now...I know I call a lot of people stupid...not always because I think they are genuinely stupid...but becasue they act that way. I think she is the real deal. I am sure that my intelligence would be sucked out if I were ever to be in the near presence of this woman. She really needs to get back to what she must do well and that is suck...there is no way that she could get published unless she was blowing people...really she has no platform...she has no intelligible ideas...I mean the woman is just useless. The only thing that the Republicans need her for is a pretty face (and hell she looks like skeletor...even more so than Maria Shriver....Ahhhnolds wife). She is the Atypical Republican woman...or at least what they would love to have all over the place. Someone who really isn't informed or intelligent and will seed to the man whenever the man needs to take 'charge'...she is a Barbie...nice and pretty to play with...but you put Barbie away whenever you need to actually take care of business.  I hope she reads this...or this gets on to her. I think you are quite possibly the most useless person on the face of this earth...hell at least even our current president is good at something...he is good at making war on everything and everyone. You on the other hand probably are good at consuming air. I don't know. I would spit on your shoes. After that I would simply ignore you...because for me to give you anymore acknowledgment of a person would be a waste of time and energy. I don't have time for stupid people.   Alan Dershowitz...he is an interesting bird...I don't actually agree with his positions on Israel...but hey we can dissagree on some things yet be united on others...  He put it very well and this argument can hold up to any litmus test of history. Try and prove it wrong.   Religion thrives only when the government keeps its hands out of it. Religion is endangered only in places where a state sponsored religion is promoted.   The final most damning one...the one that really is good.   If you need to ask the government for help in your religion (monetary or promotional) then you don't have faith in your own religion.  It states that if your religion is so whacko and out there then probably you are wrong (well at least according to market economics...which ironically is what most Republicans ascribe too...their religion is to whacky so people don't go and give to the church...hahaha...ironic)  Again I don't always agree with him. But when he is right...he is really right.  Barry Lynn is a preacher. He sees the need for church and state to be seperate. Again because once you get government involved in religion in any way...then you will be promoting a state religion. He goes as far as I do and says that 'under god' should be struck from the pledge...'in god we trust' from our money...the only place where he does not promote the stripping of references to 'god' is from the supreme court...and not because he thinks it should be there...but because the court has already ruled on it...saying basically that in the introduction for the justices and the ceremony that goes along with it are basically untouchable.   I agree...it was and has always been a part of the ceremony...blah blah blah...god save the country, blah blah blah...it really is a holdover from the British 'god save the queen'....  I have the strong belief that he holds a similar view as I do on abortion. You cannot be as seemingly enlightened as he is without having come to a similar conclusion on abortion that I have. I feel I am somewhat enlightened on things...that is why I have that view.  Being a preacher gives him street cred...and he calls for Christians to defend the constitution because if they/we don't then sooner or later our religion will be banned...it just happens that way. History shows us that...our nation was born out of that.  Nadine Strossen is the President of The ACLU...while I am not always in agreement with them...they really aren't politically scewed...they only want to fight for the constitution...which makes for some strange bedfellows.   She brought up a few myths...one was that Christians here are oppresed...she makes the point that in reality you could never be elected as president without being a christian...just wouldn't happen and may never happen.   The other is that in reality some of the most devout christians...the really good godly ones...are actually for the seperation of church and state. The believe that religion is private and should have no mettling in it from the government...  Hell the ACLU has even argued a case for Jerry Fallwell...and are currently on a case in VA for a city councelman that was giving out fliers in his campaign that essentially argued for the merging of Church and State...something about the election laws there prevent that...but the ACLU has stepped in on his behalf because they view his right to free speech and free religion are paramount over what bad he might be saying.  Overall the Liberals...or the liberal side of the panel really made its case. Not just because I am liberal or want them to win. They made it because they fired everything back at the other side...and to an open minded person made them look like alarmists.  The conservatives were just plain pitiful. They play the fear card all the time. They attempt to frame this entire issue as a moral issue.   I am tired of the right wingers out there arguing for church and state to be together and faith based initiatives...when you get into that you know that your government is no longer working for the people...all of them. Instead it has become a quasi-taliban like government that places religious ideals over all else...  Now would that be bad if the people who were in power were actually following what the 'good' book says? I dunno...but I know that if they actually lived up to the ideals described in the Bible...we would really see something quite different from what we see today.  These aren't hard concepts at all people. Really they aren't.

Tonight I watched on C-Span a debate that was held on Oct at Regent University...the topic Constitutional Judicial Activism The panelists ranged from well qualified to downright insipid Here was the lineup Nadine Strossen ALCU President Barry Lynn Americans United for the Seperation of Church State Executive Director Alan Dershowitz Havard Law Proffessor Jay Sekulow American Center for Law Justice Chief Counsil David Limbaugh Writer pundit retard Ann Coulter Writer HA pundit Double HA whore retard skeletor slut bitch cuntrag oh what else...uneducated talking head Ok...so now that we have introduced out cast of characters some woman from CourtTV was the moderator...no it wasn't that other cunt that is on Larry King Live all the time...she is a bitch of another caliber let us get down to brass tax here Basically the debate was over whether or not the Supreme Court has been meddling in politics and taking political stances and not necesarilly legal views Well the answer to this is really loaded...and it all depends on which side of the fence you sit on with a particular issue Take for instance abortion The constitution and I have to give the conservatives a little credit on this one says nothing about it It doesn't protect nor deny it...it just never mentions it...probably because it was before it really was an issue The argument on the side of the conservative now it has changed so many times from murder to morally wrong to plain out religious hatred is that the Judges should never have ruled on Roe v Wade in the first place because the court which I happen to agree with is only supposed to rule or even hear constitutional arguments...in other words it is only there for the constitution and nothing else I agree with that However in the case of Roe v Wade it was a constitutional issue as it was framed in a lawsuit because it specifically challenged a state law that limited private choice and freedom To me that is simple The court did need to weigh in on the issue By the way...if you want to know I am PRO CHOICE It is in line with my beliefs very easily...and here is why We all have the choice to do good or bad I personally wouldn't have an abortion if I was a female...but I am not so I don't have to make the choice...but that does not mean that I should be able to impose my morals or views on someone as long as their activity is not directly harming my person or property I can think that it is disgusting and horrible...but that doesn't mean that I can puch that view on someone else I would just hope that they would see it as that In my eyes...do whatever you want just don't impose it on me I took a few notes of this debate...it really was sad to see that the people in that place were actually applauding the retards on the right I call them that because they are indeed morally and socially retarded It would seem that they would love to live under a system that really doesn't give them even the choice of what they want for dinner...because to argue against the seperation of church and state which they all were arguing that they should be combined is really to argue for a system that has been proven time and time again to fail So to argue this point...or from this side is indeed retarded Like sticking your hand back into the fire five minutes after you stuck it in before and got burned David Limbaugh...who the fuck is he I dunno...but I will say this He is about as smart as horseshit in your refrigerator He actually argued that the congress should limit the Supreme Court under Article of the constitution I looked and I sure couldn't find any limiting factors there Actually it affirms that the court is pretty much above the fray of political shit that floats in our bowl of democracy He argues that what in reality has been a mostly conservative president appointed panel the court is very liberal They are out of hand and need to be replaced I dunno...but I think this guy needs to have some sense beaten into him Jay Sekulow He is a piece of work I tell ya Imagine what a failed televangilist looks like The hair plastic skin look tanned with a bad almost pimp suit on Umm yeah That is this dude He stated that President Bush is the comander and chief of the constitution What I literally shook my head at that I really don't know what that means It was probably one of the dumbest things I have heard...almost like if it hadn't have been for my horse I wouldn't have made it through college that year A famous Louis Black joke...about anuerisms and how they are caused This guy is a walking anuerism I can't think of one thing intelligent coming out of this dude Really he just didn't make sense He would say something one way and then turn it around and completely disprove his,114,test
212,212,1234212,1,27,"       So finaly this week of sheer hell is over for me now.  Lets start by saying that I really don't like the job I am doing because it is just such BS. This Kiosk that I work at sells ritzy pet things...all of it way overpriced and nothing that I personally would ever buy...but people do buy it. Yesterday I sold 33 dollars worth of stuff from 11AM to 6PM...today was even better...I sold 0.00 from 10AM to 5PM. I can tell that the woman who is going in on this is dissapointed that I am not selling more...or rather that I am not pushing people into sales. My simple philosophy is this...you either want it or you don't. I really can't make you mind up for you in the end. So my schtick is this. I walk up to the customer...but I don't interfere with their personal bubble (because I hate when people do that to me when I am in stores) I say 'Hello...how are you today'...they say a few words back and I usually reply with 'Oh things are good...if you need anything I will be here to answer questions for you.' Then I leave them pretty much alone unless they engage me in a conversation which has happened a few times. I have a no pressure approach because of my philosphy...you'll either want it or not...I can't take your wallet out and make the purchase for you.  Couple that with prices that are really to high (and she went back and raised a few prices during the week) and you have for slow days. It really isn't the holidays yet and that is when we hope it will get busy.  In the end she really can't afford me to just stand there with a goofy look on my face...and frankly I feel bad because this is supposed to be a vehicle to help get some of her debt paid down.   Here are the numbers. 5500 for the Kiosk through Christmas (I don't know if it is per month or a lump sum). Her inventory which she paid wholesale through a middle man when she could have gotten it much cheaper from the factories...and that is going to kill her there.  Plus she has me who comes in for two days a week...a total of 16 hours at what she wants to pay me (8 bucks an hour) and she also has another person who is working for her and I would imagine she has a similar deal too. Well all that adds up and she may not make it back...hell she will be lucky to break even in the end.  She has left it 'up to GOD'...and we all know that he hasn't been a real good manager.  Hell his churches blow through money left and right and are constantly begging for more.  So that is that story.  Also in this hell week my grandfather has gotten really ill. Now I am of the impression he will die real soon because he is pretty bad from what I here. I haven't been to visit him yet in the hospital. My mom came home one evening and found him collapsed on the kitchen floor. Not but a few days earlier he was backing out of his driveway and backed into a parked truck. He has been on a rapid decline over the past few weeks. He is on Dialisys and from everything I have heard you get a max of five years on that and then people die off like flies after that...and you only get to that point if you take excellent care of yourself.   Well back to the colapse. First thing you do is call the ambulance right? Well my mom has never once in her life made a sound health choice regardless of who she was having to make a decision for. I went for over a week one time with a bowel blockage when I was younger even though I knew something was wrong...but she wouldn't take me until it got to the point where I couldn't stand...even then she resented the fact that she had to take me to a doctor. Also when I was younger I never got the proper drug treatments ever...and that could have helped me now...partly because of her...partly because my dad wouldn't spend the money on the drugs (and this was before they had the really expensive stuff)...she never contacted state agencies to see if I qualified for some assistance or anything. She is just horrible when it comes to medical stuff. When my sister was in a severe wreck my mom talked her out of going to the hospital in the ambulance...turned out my sister did need to go. When it came round to getting money for the accident (it was someone else's fault) because she hadn't taken the ride she lost out on a substantial amount of money (like 50 grand or more).  So when she found him collapsed she first tried to administer aid herself. Got him up to his room because he wanted to pee. Then she finally got around to calling his PCP. Now what were they gonna say 'give him an aspirin'...no they said to call the ambulance immediately. So she finally did more than an hour after she found him on the floor. Compounding all of this was a fever that was rising and eventually is topping out (he still has it) at 104F.   She said he was very jaundice (yellow skin tone) and that is a sign that things aren't working right. With his bad kidneys it is probably cause by that because once they shut down other things shut down as well like the liver. He is essentially having organ failures...and on top of it he has a heart condition...smokes, drinks, doesn't eat right the whole nine yards...so I told her that she has always made bad decisions when it comes to health and just listen to me on this one...I ended up being right.  She got upset when I told her that...and it may have hurt her feelings...but I said it because it was the truth and in this situation she could face charges if she didn't act properly...and she didn't. She flat out didn't. Fortunately her ass is covered now...he excuse was that she needed to get the PCP to get things arranged so he could go strait in...well ER have doctors too and they would be just as well versed with medical conditions...and they could have called his PCP to get full details.  On top of it all she has had Jesse's box to send back to him...in all the rush and hub-ub she forgot about it which I can understand that...she is able to get a big ass discount on sending it through Fed-Ex so she said she would get it in to them in the morning and have it delivered overnight service...she was going to try today but got detained at the hospital with all this shit.  Heres the kick in the balls...my lung infection is not over...and I know as soon as I stop the meds on Wednesday within two weeks tops I will be back in the hospital...because these bugs I have are just not responding to the meds they have me on...  Sometimes I just want to say fuck it all and quit.  What I have felt for a long time and my friend Danielle (who is also a CF patient) elloquently said...'We are so old yet so young. It is a crime.'  That is what it is alright. A crime. I have friends who are out there and in relative health yet they complain about meaningless bullshit...oh my back hurts, I have this ailment, or that one...shut the fuck up people.  You aren't sick. You haven't even begun to experience what some unfortunate people have had to deal with. For the older folks out there...I understand that it is a bummer to start to have your health fail knowing that sooner or later you are going to die...but you have lived a full life. Those of us who are young and have to deal with all this shit seem to have a much better grasp on it and accept what will come of us.   I would never wish this on anyone...but if some people could walk a day in my shoes to see they shit I have to do...and when that shit stops working is when you truely become fucked...and for me things are no longer working.  Before I exit this planet I hope to make a difference...I want to write a couple of papers...and maybe a book. I have material that I have scribbled all over the place and in that material I am sure is some great stories and possibly some interesting ideas.  I just can hope that I can realize some of the things in my head before they die with me.  Oh and I figured out what I want done with my body when I die...first I want it to be a research corpse...something so students can disect me and play with my guts...but then I want to be cremated and then have the ashes taken to one of the new labs that can take a persons ashes and turn them into diamonds. So that is what I want done with me. I want to become eternal...and what better way than through a diamond. In addition I want to have some genetic samples drawn and preserved (preferrably encased in the diamond or the ring that will hold the diamond) so that maybe in a future time they will be able to clone me...at least it will be a historical record that will say to someone in the distant future...he lies Michael Honse in stone, DNA attached for reference.

215,215,1234212,1,27,"       Well I got into another verbal sparring match with my mom today over the issues facing all of us.  She is still blind when it comes down to it...in the past I have considered her to be an informed and therefore educatable person...but I retract that idea. She still cannot see that the policies both my grandmothers and her generation have tried and used have failed and therefore have sown the seeds of discontent in the world. She cannot understand that the reason we are under attack from so many sides is because of the policies of prior generations and her own towards both Africa, The Middle East, and Asia and her subcontinent have put us directly in the crosshairs. She cannot bring herself to the idea that we aren't the good guys when it comes to  those parts of the world...that indeed we are the enemy and it isn't because we are 'the infadel' or some other novel idea...but instead simply because we have opressed and killed many of their fellow countryman.  When you have the policies that the United States has had since the end of WW2 (1945 for those of you who have no clue of history) you are bound to make enemies.   We have consistantly had policies that bring us wealth and power while leaving the rest of the world with the tab. You see wealth is a finite thing. You can think of it in the simplest of terms...and here they are.  The world is made up of three disinct things...people, space, resources. Each disting thing you can break down into tenths. For the United States we have the following pieces of the pie...in people we have one fourth of one tenth of a percent in algebraic terms 1/4(1/10)% (we have about 280 million citizens the world has roughly 6.5 billion people)...in space we take up about the same amount...in resources we consume about 2.5 tenths (or 25 percent)...and if you want to boggle the mind we pump out about 25% of the total polution in the world.  Now our population is growing at the average world rate...with that growth it would not be long before we would require the entire power output of the world...so as it is now.  Now take into mind that our current power suppliers (oil, natural gas, and leastly coal) are all fossil fuels that are rapidly declining in supply...you end up with a population that is eating more and more power...with less and less available...and the rest of the world...well we Americans don't care about that do we?  That is where the resentment starts to come into play...not so much that in these little shit countries around the world even really need tons of energy like we do...but that we are taking their share of it without really paying them for it...so we are stealing it...and don't give me the line 'we pay 30 dollars a barrel of oil'...yeah our oil companies pay that to themselves...and the money eventually heads off to regimes that don't like us...but like our money, and in turn those regimes opress their people and torture their citizens...when if they didn't have that money in the first place everyone would be on equal footing.  It really is so complex a problem that it is hard to lay it out in a way that makes sense to the Average person. It's not that people can't understand it...but rather they would prefer to think of America as this big benevolant provider of goodness throughout the world. When in fact that our government has long been involved in things that would never happen here...we funded a shaw in Iran for years that killed untold numbers of his own people...then he was overthrown by Radical Muslims (who then turned their hatred towards us because we backed the shaw)...then we paid for and helped the Iraqi regime of Sadaam Hussein develop WMD's to kill Iraniians (who for them confirmed we were out to get them so they hated us even more) not to mention that the people of Iraq knew where the weapons we coming from and the money was coming from (America)...the people that were propping up that evil regime...then when we looked like would fix it all and called on the people of Iraq to rise up with us against him in 1991 we left them flat...don't think they forgot that (so now we are targets there).  Afghanistan...we have an even worse story there. Nobody in the sixties or seventies could tell you where that country was...hell most people here now couldn't find it on a map (so much for our great educational system...leave no child behind...). Then in the eighties the USSR (our great evil foe...that is a whole 'nother story) invaded because it was on the lower end of the great Caspian basin of oil (they tried to consolodate the entire capsian region for oil purposes knowing that if they controlled oil they controlled the world)...so what did we do. Well we just got out of Vietnam so we weren't going to go rushing in there...plus not to mention it would have been directly Russians against Americans so we sent money....and lots of it. Untold billions actually. We funded a little known dude at that time named Usama Bin Laden (or Osama if you spell it the way americans do) and his Al Queda network (not sure on the spelling of that) and the mujohadine (again spelling) that fought against the Russian. We even sent advisors (as we did in Vietnam in the beginning) to teach them to fight. Well we taught them well as the Russians taught the Vietnamese well how to resist an invading Army...the Russians suffered a million or so casualties...but at our dollar.  When they pulled out in 88 everyone sang and danced it was a great victory for all but the Afghani's...because once the Russians left...so did our dollars (even though many people were of the mind to keep dollars flowing in to stabilize the political future as to a pro-western government...but we got burned on Iran so we decided not too)...when our dollars left the country fell into civil war for the next oh....lets say 10 years (our own was a brutal 4 years long) from which emerged the Taliban. Lo and behold we started funding them. The money was to obstensively go towards the destruction of poppy fields in our war against drugs...and they were effective at that as well as killing people, cutting clitorises off, stoning...all sorts of fun. When we asked for a little favor in return (an oil pipeline secured by troops from the Caspian bowl to India where an get ready for it....Enron power plant was) we were flatly denied...this coincided with the Planes into the towers...  Don't get me wrong. We should have gone after the people who perpetrated that. However if you will all recall it happened once before. We knew at the time (or soon after) that it was Al-Queda as we caught the dude behind it and he pointed his finger at bin Laden. Now why did we not go then? We could have (some people would say we didn't have the balls or Pres Clinton was weak...well he wasn't he actually promoted an unpopular position in the Baltics and sent troops to somolia which he then abandoned) tehn but didn't. People died then as well and they struck out our guts...but this time was a little different. And besides we knew who it was but we still haven't found him...why did we need to invade when all we could have used was special forces to surgically weed him out. Because we had a larger goal.  A lot of this is round the board on the 'making sense scale'...but from what I have read, put together on my own, and been shown is this. That America really isn't as great as we think we are...sure we have all these great things (which I readily partake in)...but it all comes at a cost to the rest of the world. We steal, polute, and rape everyone else in the world so we can live the way we do...using the current technology we have.  How can we change it all. Well first of all we need more nuclear power....hey it is unpopular and has had its fair share of problems...but overall it is still fairly safe and can give us the go juice in a few years time rather than having to curb our appetites while waiting for better technology. The other thing we can do is research research research...and a little research on the side. We can innovate our way out of this...we can invent our way out...we just need to spend the money to do so. Under the current system we never will...but maybe just maybe the system will change a little this next election and we will see real change and maybe we can get ourselves out of this mess...  As for cleaning up the human collateral we have spilled around the world...we can't. All we can do is sit back and take the lumps on the chin. It doesn't mean we have to take it laying down...but it means that we have to live up to the mistakes we have made and make a good faith effort to fix them.  Point out one country that we haven't screwed and you get a gold star...cause we have screwed them all...if you look back far enough.

216,216,1234212,1,27,"       Ok I have a lot of things that I want to tackle tonight so bear with me as while I am in the hospital I have nothing much else to do.  The first thing that I want to discuss and give my opinion on is this new law (well it is a law that has been on the books and been available for use since 1967. It is only for Ohio but I can imagine other states will be watching to see how it works out.   News Story   Well in Ohio some judges are going to start using this. If you didn't read the article it is a special license plate for people convicted of DUI. Now this special tag is different from all the other tags in that it is yellow with red lettering.   Now from a completely common sense view I see that 'hey this might be good and might cut down on accidents or DUI's'...but then I get into my civil libertarian mode and I can see that there is a real problem with this rational.  Ok lemme just state a few things. Most DUI drivers probably have done it more than once and really don't see much of a problem with it all. Even when caught these people continue to do it inspite of the law.   Now I can honestly say that I have done it a few times but out of those few times there was only once that I was truly a menace and should not have done it...and looking back I would not have done it. Actually happened recently when I was living in Indiana and my roommates and I were at a house party and I was the only one that was barely standing at the end of the evening. Fortunately we only had to go a few blocks and it was very late at night and I have always been a good driver...so we made it without incident. I will say I will never do that again because when I got back to the apartment I got out of the car and screamed 'I was way to drunk for that!!! I will never ever do that again'...then I profusely thanked the gods above because I really should not have done that.  Ok with that little story out of the way I will go back to this law. It gives the judge the power to convict DUI people to have this special license plate. Again not wholely unreasonable...but when you consider that if you are someone with one of those tags on you will attract attention not just from your fellow motorists (which hey it is supposed to warn them that you have DUI's in your past) but it tips off police agencies.  Ok so what it tips off the police? Well think of it this way. Police when they pull you over and want to search your vehicle they have to have probable cause to carry out the search. With this tag not only would the vehicle garner additional attention from law enforcement but also set up automatic probable cause for police to just search your vehicle.   Alarmest am I? Yes on this definitely.  I think that in reality you could make a good constitutional case against this law using privacy rights and 5th ammendment rights. One is privacy and if you have this tag you stick out like a sore thumb and people know your private problems...but the worse violation is against the Fifth Amemdment. Basically it says that you have the right to refuse to incriminate yourself and cannot be compelled to. This tag could be seen (from my eyes) that you have just tossed that sucker out the window. Having the tag on the back automatically prejudices any officer who pulls you over to go through a whole batery of tests (sobriety mainly) and then the officer would want to search your vehicle which because of your tag they have probable cause so you can't stop them.  Here is the perfect storm example of this. John Doe got a DUI conviction and still has his license but has the new plates. John Doe also runs drugs from Cincinnatti to Columbus. You are cruising along and not breaking any apparent laws. You aren't speeding nor driving irratically but you get pulled over regardless because of your tag. Now they run the tests and find nothing but continue to search the car 'because you never know'...and even if you were to say 'don't search my car' they can say not only from that statement but also because of the tag that they have probable cause to do it. Of course they tear the car apart and find the twenty pounds of pot.  That is the scenaro I see. To me that is a great problem.  Another thing is more dissendence in the Rank and File Israeli armed services.   More troop refuse party lines.   Basically these guys are the uber elite fighters (more secretive than SEALS, Green Berrets, SAS...and likely better trained) of the Israeli Defense Force. The IDF has had some problems as just recently 27 pilots have decided against flying these assasination mission which are illegal under international law. So this uber force has said no we aren't going to continue to kill palestinians and deprive them of basic rights.  This is not only a blow to the extreme right wingers in Israel but also here. America has to come to grips with how we are going to deal with our child over there.   Now it is not anti-semetic to talk critically of Israel's issues as long as you acknowledge their right to a state. While I have different feelings on that (mostly because they are essentially setting up a racist gov. that doesn't want anyone outside of their ethnic background to be a part of...that is a whole 'nother can of worms) I do recognize they are indeed a state and are soveriegn. They have the right to exist is as plainly as I can put it.  However to blindly support Israel is just plane dumb. It is like saying to your kid 'its ok you killed you cousin, and we won't mind if it happens again'. What has been going on over there has been a systematic attempt from both side to wipe each other off the planet. That is the key...both sides.  You cannot deny that the Palestinians have done some horrible things that are simply barbaric, the same goes for the Israeli's as they have done horrible things to their brothers.  So why do we as Americans blindly support Israel and all its policies when clearly the support for those policies is surely waining in their own nation? I can't give you an answer outside of that we here in the states are afraid to question it for fear of having the Anti-Defimation League crawl all over anyone who talks out of turn. They did it recently to Dean on the mere suggestion that we may want to take a more even handed approach to Israel/Palestine.  Today on my way down to the hospital I stopped to get a pepsi and some three musketeer bars at sheetz in our little burb. Low and behold I saw a H2 there. If I had been in better shape I would have confronted the owner and asked him how he felt about the 400+ lives that have been lost so he can run his vehicle. I also wanted to ask him if he was compensating for a small penis. What is sickening is all the commercials on tv for them lately. I think what is happening is that people are getting in there and looking at them and then they are told of the Tax Credit for those vehicles if they register them under a business. If a person buys a big SUV over a certain weight there is a tax credit that you can get if you register it under your business or phoney business (its not hard to 'start' a business). You can actually recieve the total cost of an H2 back in one year as a tax credit...basically the Government pays you to buy the vehicle.  That really pissed me off. I tried to get my camera out so I could get a picture of me flipping the H2 off and the owner as well. I believe this guy lives in Springdale and I may track him down and tell him what I think of his hummer and maybe insult the size of his obviously small dick.  Oh I have more don't you worry...I have a lot to say about the Mad Cow thing and many other issues and I will get to them over the next few days...you just wait. I guess I have been waiting for the right time to get to it all...  Peace...and if you see people driving a H2 get a picture of you flipping them off and lemme know and I will give you a site that you can have it posted on. A site dedicated to the hatred of the H2 and its complete lack of anything remotely needed.         ",5218,1000,Ok I have a lot of things that I want to tackle tonight so bear with me as while I am in the hospital I have nothing much else to do The first thing that I want to discuss and give my opinion on is this new law well it is a law that has been on the books and been available for use since It is only for Ohio but I can imagine other states will be watching to see how it works out News Story Well in Ohio some judges are going to start using this If you didn't read the article it is a special license plate for people convicted of DUI Now this special tag is different from all the other tags in that it is yellow with red lettering Now from a completely common sense view I see that hey this might be good and might cut down on accidents or DUI's'...but then I get into my civil libertarian mode and I can see that there is a real problem with this rational Ok lemme just state a few things Most DUI drivers probably have done it more than once and really don't see much of a problem with it all Even when caught these people continue to do it inspite of the law Now I can honestly say that I have done it a few times but out of those few times there was only once that I was truly a menace and should not have done it...and looking back I would not have done it Actually happened recently when I was living in Indiana and my roommates and I were at a house party and I was the only one that was barely standing at the end of the evening Fortunately we only had to go a few blocks and it was very late at night and I have always been a good driver...so we made it without incident I will say I will never do that again because when I got back to the apartment I got out of the car and screamed I was way to drunk for that I will never ever do that again'...then I

219,219,1234212,1,27,"       So I ended up in the hospital at 4:30 yesterday (Sunday) morning because I had an ongoing allergic reaction to something. I woke up Sunday and my lip was very swollen due to some allergy. I had taken about 150 mg of benadryl throughout the day and it just continued on to hives then swelling in my neck and throat to the point I lost my voice for three hours or so.  It turns out to be some freak thing that I have had happen in the past but in the past I was able to stave it off with benadryl, it was a little different this time because it didn't respond. They gave me 125 mg of solumedrol and IV zantac. It brought the itching down but the hives were still there. It is all pretty much done I am still a bit itchy but at least the hive are gone for now.  Outside of that not much is going on. I am going to try and see 'The Day After Tomorrow' later today (I almost said tomorrow). I am also going to look for a little film called 'Saved' or something like that. It is a film about a Christian School that Falwell was just on CNN blasting even though he admitted he hadn't seen the movie.  As much as I can remember about my times in Christian schools I always found they were filled with horrid children and teachers. We went because my parents had just moved to the area and heard the public school were bad. Well the christian schools were worse because they tended to collect those who had been thrown out of public schools and those who's parents were rich sent their spoiled children to school. You had the worst of both socio-economic classes...and that always ends bad if you are in the middle of it all.  I wanna say a little about the evil that is Jerry Fallwell. He is an evil horrid man that if there is a 'god' I would hope that 'god' will send him straight to hell because of what he preaches. He plainly preaches hate. There is nothing christian about his views outside of him framing himself as a christian. He is a neo-nazi'ish bastard of the evangelical movement. He has capitalized on the fears of what I feel are mostly good people. I do not agree with most evangelicals because they teach what is essentially no different from what the Taliban or right wing of any religion teaches. Convert or die and go to hell. The difference basically for the evangelicals is that they are mostly here (with the exception of those in Africa and they do what I am about to describe) and don't have the opportunity at killing people who don't.  In Africa, the Middle East, and many parts of second and third world nations religious radicals or extremists do go around beheading and raping villages. We constantly talk about how the radical religious extremists, and many times comentators don't even bother to differentiate them form normal muslims. We talk about how horrible they are and how truely disgusting the acts that the extremists do when they burn some people or behead a person. It is no different from what happens in many other nations with and equal ratio of christian to muslim atrocities. With extremists in both camps constantly going back and forth killing literally thousands of people.  Extremists always go to the most extreme that a population will tolerate, that is what makes them extremists. If the extremists could get away with killing people here we would see a lot more often. We would see more Tim McVeys, we would see more serial killers. We would also see more religious extremists killing people off. It happens elsewhere, the only reason it doesn't happen here is because it is not acceptable. Many of us are just run of the mill people that do not acsribe to the extremists of any religion or political view and when we see those people we tend to wince and turn our heads.   On that note I will say that we have seen a marked shift in politics and religion in this nation towards more radical conservatism (which actually means bigger government and more wars) and more fundamentalist religious views. In moving that direction we have seen a degredation of intelectualism. The religious right come out in droves to fight anyone who questions their ideals or puts to task any of their teachings on history whether ancient or recent. That has been largely seen as acceptable and many mainstream christians have fallen prey to those extremists because it is framed as attacks of christianity and their ideals. When all that is asked is whether or not the historical accounts are correct when they are posed by 'christian leaders'.   Mainstream christians, jews, and muslims need to drive these fundamentalists out of their ranks because those are the people that drive wedges between the moderates and always (always as in throughout history) drives those same moderates to war. It is always the moderates who suffer at the hands of extremists because by the time the moderates are driven into war it is because the extremists have come to power. The extremists are therefor through position protected from being one of those who have to fight. You can see it here right now. Ask any of the right wing hawks of the republican wing (or hawks of the democratic party) if they would be willing to fight or send their children as front line troops. The universally known answer is no. Instead they send pretty much moderate americans to go fight for their extremist views.  All I ask is that we move back towards education and to hold that educating and intellectualism isn't a bad thing. We see week in and week out what football or baseball and basketball teams do at tournaments and in games yet we hear only once a year about some great students who have nothing to do with sports. We have university sports programs that have many of their students attending on partial or full scholarships, yet an english department may have only one or two students who get scholarships if lucky. As long as we reward the lack of intellectualism we will continue to see the nation move to the right. The greatest period of enlightenment in this nation of recent times came during the 60's. Not that we had a lot of great things but we had artists, thinkers, scholars who came out of this period and thrived during it as well. We saw some of the greatest laws passed during this period and many programs that have been overall good for the republic. Yet many people look back on it and think 'those damn hippies'. Well out of those hippies we had many of the greatest artists and thinkers of recent history. It all came to us via a educational culture that had influence at the time. Many kids were forced into college because of Vietnam and out of that we ended up getting excellent engineers and technology that has changed the world. While it is true we have more college students as percentage now than then the difference is that at that point in time students were encouraged to be students and thinkers and were not looked down on for being such. Now you go to college and you are looked down on in class by others if you attempt to be good at what you are doing. When you do well you are then expected to help others cheat by those who are poor students by them sitting next to you and copying (I have had that happen many times...I get a 90 or better on a test and everyone around me would get the same score!).  We just need to promote thinking again...unfortunately we need to see it from the top and right now the top is a C average student and someone who proclaims proudly that he doesn't read often. If you don't read you don't know...do they draw cartoons like they did for Reagan (they actually did do cartoons for him so he could learn about a weapon system as claimed by Dr. Helen Cladicut who was the only no-nuke advocate to meet with him and she summed him up as being of low IQ...she is a doc so I believe her...she is a pediatrician).  We need educated people who are willing to stand up and be educated and then spread the idea that the fundamentalists are anti-intellectual and therefor should be dismissed as uneducated.

226,226,1234212,1,27,"       I just woke up from the strangest set of dreams I think I have had in a long while.  It was a series in which I would get into a dream, wake up then fall back asleep and continue the previous dream. Strange I tell you.  What was the subject of this dream. Its more like who was the subject of it.   These dreams were about my ex Beth. So here goes the entire set of dreams.  In my dreams she was about to marry some dude that I never got to see in the dream. I wasn't going to have that and I was going to stop the wedding. Almost 'Freshman' style without the church and banging on the glass. Anyways I ran into her at a mall and she was surrounded by security people almost like police. When I got close I just said to her 'does he make you laugh like I do' (a similar line of that in Oceans Eleven). We get into a short conversation and she then alarmedly tells me to scram cause he was on his way back and wouldn't be happy if I was there. Pretty soon the security people see me and start chasing me through the mall. I give good chase (here is a little note for you out there. I would love to be able to run and it is little dream of mine but my lungs are so fucked that I can't run or be physical more than a mear minute before collapsing from oxygen deprivation...I need to work on that but I doubt I will ever be able to be physical again...it is really frustrating.).   I get to a store and now hear that the police are chasing me as well because the security must have called them and said something, because the police thought I had a gun and was on the hunt for me. I get to the end of the mall and it is some superstore type place with all kinds of goodies and of coarse I stop and look at the electronics because I am a nerd. The police spot me but I vanish into the back of the store, the storage area and make with ninja stealth technics and make my way past several of them back into the store itself. I then get to the front through the super long dairy food isle that bottomed out on the liqour center. I walked past the counters and got outside. Then all hell breaks loose again.  I see from the one side a police vehicle screaming towards me with sirens blasting. So what do I do, run like a bullet. I mean in this dream I streaked across the parking lot (remember this is a super mall type place and it is in suburban hell). I make with the ninja crouching tiger hidden dragon skills and hop up onto the top of a mini-strip mall thing to avoid the cops. I make my way across the roof and get to a stand of trees. I then hop in them. Now the trees are wet like after a rain so I was getting soaked by their leaves. The first ones I jump into are pine trees I make my way through them and into a small stand of older hardwoods. From there I hop down and run across a neighborhood with the police chasing me all the way. I hop back onto a roof and then to another which is another store. I then hope from the store into a courtyard that has this large porn sign above it notifying me that I had jumped into something of a strip club parking lot only I got the backyard place of here. I jumped in the middle of several stripper types and said 'excuse me ladies, if cops come looking say that I wasn't here.' They all nodded and said they wouldn't say I was there. I then lept out of there. Now in my dream I must have been even better looking that I am in real life because shit to get any woman to do something like that is nearly inpossible without a large diamond or lots of cash and I had neither in the dream.  Now the next dream in the series. I guess the wedding was called off because I went over to her house only it wasn't here real life house. It was this mansion type place that was gorgeous. I did a ninja stealth approach but I soon learned it wouldn't be nesecary because they were expecting me. Especially Beth. In this dream something was slightly different than in person. She had a boob job. Her boobs really weren't any bigger but they were fuller and just different than in real life I guess. (I haven't seen them unclothed in a long time so I don't know what they look like) Anyways I go to her room and I just crawl into bed with her. We just lay there and are close to each other.  At this point I woke up. I tried going back to sleep to get more and I did. However when I woke up it was the most peacefull fealing I have ever had. I was just so calm...I don't know how to explain it really.  I got back to sleep and the dream kinda continued. This time I went off to get something and came back and she was taking a mud bath. I played with her while she was muddy it was fun in the dream. Of coarse we had sex in my dreams what good dreams are there for a guy without sex attached. However it wasn't an illicit sex dream. I knew that we were going to have sex but it was like a movie where we got started then it would flash to the end when we were in post coital cuddle. Strange indeed. Again I was waking up with this sense of calm.  I don't know what it was all about and the only thing that I can come up with is that I am lonely. Lonely beyond all belief. However even if their was someone I don't think that I could open up to them.  The closest I got to opening up was with Beth, I have told her that and I don't know if she believes me on it. Just simply becuase we ended so weirdly I don't know what she thinks about that period. I know she was mad about it all becuase she wasn't in the loop of my mental illness at that time.   I am starting to ramble because I don't know what I need. I can't really invest the energy in getting a new girlfriend and I really don't know if thats what I want. By investing energy I mean that it was so much mentally from me the first time around that it exhausted me, nearly drove me nuts, and now my health is much worse. That is another point I am not healthy, really I don't know how much time I have and there is no one out there who wants to have anything to do with that.   There is no woman out there strong enough to deal with that. To deal with someone they care about or love knowing they will die soon. I don't think there is any female that can cope with that. I have seen guys do it, but women don't seem to be able to handle that. Besides I really wouldn't want to do that to a woman. Fall in love then leave.   This leaves me with a dilema. I am lonely and need that, but how do I get it? Plus someone already has my heart. I have told her before and she tells me to 'stop that' or move on essentially, but I am not built that way unfortunately.   I don't really want sex per-se. I want intimacy.   Jeesh...I am all bound up now...talk amongst yourselves I'll give you a topic. What's wrong with me?         ",4867,1000,I just woke up from the strangest set of dreams I think I have had in a long while It was a series in which I would get into a dream wake up then fall back asleep and continue the previous dream Strange I tell you What was the subject of this dream Its more like who was the subject of it These dreams were about my ex Beth So here goes the entire set of dreams In my dreams she was about to marry some dude that I never got to see in the dream I wasn't going to have that and I was going to stop the wedding Almost Freshman style without the church and banging on the glass Anyways I ran into her at a mall and she was surrounded by security people almost like police When I got close I just said to her does he make you laugh like I do a similar line of that in Oceans Eleven We get into a short conversation and she then alarmedly tells me to scram cause he was on his way back and wouldn't be happy if I was there Pretty soon the security people see me and start chasing me through the mall I give good chase here is a little note for you out there I would love to be able to run and it is little dream of mine but my lungs are so fucked that I can't run or be physical more than a mear minute before collapsing from oxygen deprivation...I need to work on that but I doubt I will ever be able to be physical again...it is really frustrating I get to a store and now hear that the police are chasing me as well because the security must have called them and said something because the police thought I had a gun and was on the hunt for me I get to the end of the mall and it is some superstore type place with all kinds of goodies and of coarse I stop and look at the electronics because I am a nerd The police spot me but I vanish into the back of the store the storage area and make with ninja stealth technics and make my way past several of them back into the store itself I then get to the front through the super long dairy food isle that bottomed out on the liqour center I walked past the counters and got outside Then all hell breaks loose again I see from the one side a police vehicle screaming towards me with sirens blasting So what do I do run like a bullet I mean in this dream I streaked across the parking lot remember this is a super mall type place and it is in suburban hell I make with the ninja crouching tiger hidden dragon skills and hop up onto the top of a mini-strip mall thing to avoid the cops I make my way across the roof and get to a stand of trees I then hop in them Now the trees are wet like after a rain so I was getting soaked by their leaves The first ones I jump into are pine trees I make my way through them and into a small stand of older hardwoods From there I hop down and run across a neighborhood with the police chasing me all the way I hop back onto a roof and then to another which is another store I then hope from the store into a courtyard that has this large porn sign above it notifying me that I had jumped into something of a strip club parking lot only I got the backyard place of here I jumped in the middle of several stripper types and said excuse me ladies if cops come looking say that I wasn't here They all nodded and said they wouldn't say I was there I then lept out of there Now in my dream I must have been even better looking that I am in real life because shit to get any woman to do something like that is nearly inpossible without a large diamond or lots of cash and I had neither in the dream Now the next dream in the series I guess the wedding was called off because I went over to her house only it wasn't here real life house It was this mansion type place that was gorgeous I did a ninja stealth approach but I soon learned it wouldn't be nesecary because they were expecting me Especially Beth In this dream something was slightly different than in person She had a boob job Her boobs really weren't any bigger but they were fuller and just different than in real life I guess I haven't seen them unclothed in a long time so I don't know what they look like Anyways I go to her room and I just crawl into bed with her We just lay there and are close to each other At this point I woke up I tried going back to sleep to get more and I did However when I woke up it was the most peacefull fealing I have ever had I was just so calm...I don't know how to explain it really I got back to sleep and the dream kinda continued This time I went off to get something and came back and she was taking a mud bath I played with her while she was muddy it was fun in the dream Of coarse we had sex in my dreams what good dreams are there for a guy without sex attached However it wasn't an illicit sex dream I knew that we were going to have sex but it was like a movie where we got started then it would flash to the end when we were in post coital cuddle Strange indeed Again I was waking up with,84,test
227,227,1234212,1,27,"       I went to see the Matrix Reloaded movie...ahhh that was a kick ass film...I have a feeling this year will be a panicopia of films. All sequels...but so far all of the sequels have kicked ass!  So lemme tell you about Reloaded. Reloaded and Revolutions were filmed at the same time for around 300 million...of that roughly half of the budget went into 'wow' effects...in other words CG and Special Effects...and lemme tell you they certainly got their bang for the buck! It simply kicked much ass. Some people have complained that there is no story and that it is just a long action sequence...and well there is a story and it is bolstered by the action most definitely.   There is one scene in the movie where the 'evils' of man is being explained and they flash Hitler, the A-Bomb and some other things...then they flash across the screen both of the President Bushs'...to call them evil is going a little far...but I will say neither man has lived up to 'good' standards...so I can see where they are coming from (even though I did vote for this Bush in the last election).  The story is simple...after thinking about ten minutes about it I got it. You have to wait till the end of the movie before they really 'bend your noodle' but it is well worth the wait. So here is the story in a short and simple fashion.  Mankind goes in cycles. History goes in cycles. Everything that was will be again and everything that is will be destroyed. Throughout history mankind has built up many great civilizations. The Greeks, Romans, Egyptions, Syrians, English, Spanish, French, Russians, Japanese, and even Germans. They all built empires that eventually imploded and left the regions decimated and in tatters. People may say 'well the Americans haven't done that and we will not repeat the fate of those other great nations and civilizations.' Well folks we will repeat it...over and over again. Sure once America per se is gone another great power in the world will grow and take over, but it too will fall in time. Humans are doomed to repeat history...its as simple as that.  However. There is one way that we can defeat history and move forward and continue on our journey through time. The only way to do that is to shed the old, get rid of the old way of doing things such as building wealth, building power, and rid ourselves of our fudal past. How you ask. First we need to stop looking at everything as a competition. We all compete on a daily basis. We compete for a better lane position at a red light, we compete for the hottest chick on the dancefloor, we compete for world resources. Sure competition drives technology and drives humans to do better things, but at the same time we take the competition to far in many cases. We compete out of fear and intolerance.   History has taught us that this competition only drives us to failure in the end because no one can have everything. Not everyone can have unlimited resources and expect the rest of the world or people of the world to go with this ideal willingly. We are in that same situation right now. America has become resource needy. We need massive amounts of everything to just survive as we see it. We need billions of barrels of oil to function anually. We need billions of metric tons of natural gas to heat our homes. We simply need to much to get by. Now if it were only us in the world that might not be so bad. But we are but a small portion of the worlds population yet we consume the most resources by far.   How can we stop it. How can we not repeat history. Well I really don't have all the answers, but I do know this. We need to be more tolerant of other peoples needs in the world. We are the richest nation on the Earth yet we have massive amounts of people without even basic health care coverage, yet don't seem to mind sending billions of dollars to Africa to 'stop' AIDS. Is that a bad thing trying to stop AIDS in Africa...no it isn't, but the money would be better spent on developing cures and vaccines for the AIDS virus...then once we have those drugs we could easily erradicate AIDS everywhere. A worldwide innoculation campaign to stop it. We spend more money on learning about the male erection than we do on many diseases...in all our priorities are fucked up.  Another step would be to start giving services away. No I am not talking about making everything for free...that wouldn't work either because to many people would simply choose not to do anything and sooner or later that type of system would crash...but basic things like food, water, drugs, health care...make those things a non-issue...a happy well fed people are generally healthier, and less violent. If we fix things here first...and we make really significant changes here then we can export those changes and guess what...those people who have less then us all of a sudden don't have less then us. They have food, health care...they have the means in which to live.   We need to stomp out materialism. I know I know...I love my toys and gadgets and fancy things as much as everyone else. I love sitting in front of a computer with two Flat Panel Screens and having my desk cluttered with electronic gadgets...do I need them all. No. However they do make life more bearable. Does everyone need these things...yes. We all need some level of materialism. It helps us...makes us feel better about ourselves...are these things nesecary for life...nope...but they make life a little more fun.  We live in an unprecidented time folks. We have a lot of choices to make. We can choose to get along and bring everyone to a reasonable level of 'consumerism' and 'materialism' yet function as a planet. But that is a choice that has to made. It has to made by people, it has to made by the leaders.   We fight amongst ourselves like five years olds fighting over a swing. We can choose to make things better. We can choose to drive more efficient vehicles and demand that the government mandate that...we can choose that car companies make more efficient vehicles and move towards alternative fuels...we can choose that here because we have a system that is based on market demand. We can choose with our dollars.   We can choose with our votes politicians or people with better world views. People that see the problems and choose to say something about it and try to do something to correct them.   Face it folks if we don't choose to go down the path that hasn't been traveled before then we choose to repeat history. The old well worn path is easy to follow. It is the new untested path that we have never chosen to go down before that will lead to our salvation as a nation and a species. There are so many bigger problems out there. We could be hit by an asteroid tomorrow...we have no plans for that...hell we only scan 2 percent of the sky for rogue rocks headed our way. We will run out of oil soon. Our entire world that we know is oil based. Many synthetic products start their lives as oil. We can choose to move to alternative energy sources and spend billions on learning how to 'do' fusion instead of building new nuclear weapons. All of these things we have the power to do. But because it is so much more difficult to do that than to keep the status quo we always choose the easier path.   And that my friends is the quandry we face. Do we choose to go the easy way. Or do we choose to go the harder way.   Red Pill or Blue Pill. The choice is yours.

237,237,1234212,1,27,"       Well over at Brassmask's site we have been having a spirited debate on whether or not we supported Saddam and Al-Queda and Bin-Laden...which we have supported all of the above. It can be proven and frankly anyone who would deny that we helped them out would have to be foolish.  It has been interesting because there is someone over there that has basically said it is all liberal lies that we supported them. I really don't know how someone could make that claim seeing that the government has even said it supported them both and made a mistake.  Some people I guess just have a really short memory.  Something that I posted over there and I have not posted here yet...I believe is this.  We have a real problem developing over in Pakistan. President Musarif (don't know the exact spelling) took the country in a coup in 1999. He did it very wisely because Pakistan had by then become a nuclear nation. He waited until they had them developed and then took over. Imediately the nation was put on our terrorist state list but we didn't really do anything to stop it all because they were a nuclear state.  We did filter much money through Pakistan and their ISSA (similar to our CIA) to the mujahideen in Afghanistan and the Taliban. We did this even after we placed them on our lists. We continued to put money through there because it was seen as an asset to us.  At the same time we were in direct negotiations with the Taliban government in Afghanistan to try and get a pipeline through the nation that would eventually lead down to a power station in India owned by Enron. This pipeline was turned down by the Taliban not all that earlier than 9/11/01.   However we still pumped in millions a year in aid to help them destroy poppy fields that supplied opium. We did this as part of our war on drugs. The money of coarse was used for other things but we will never know for sure where all of it went.   Well during all of this the Taliban and Al-Queda were relatively neutral towards Pakistan and Musarif...they didn't like them but didn't mind them...they just sort of left each other alone and it was a good arrangement.   After 9/11/01 Musarif aligned himself with the US and that basically knocked him off the fence for Bin-Laden and crew. He is now seen as a threat and they will do whatever they can to take him out. In fact he has had many attempts made on his life over the past few weeks. All attempts believed to be being made by Radical Islamic groups.  Now this is a problem because sooner or later he will be killed and the country will swing very violently over to a Islamic Fundamentalist government. This government will be in step with Bin-Laden and since Pakistan is a nuclear state Bin-Laden will at long last have access to nuclear weapons.  Now with our current precarious position in the middle east we really are not in any shape to take on this new emerging threat as well as continue our operations in Iraq and elsewhere. Our military is extremely overstretched and we would have to re-instate a draft to make up the numbers we need to fight this new fight.  Also we have a long standing tradition of not actually attacking nations that could possibly pose a threat to us as Pakistan may be actually able to with its nuclear arsenal. So we have that dimension to it all.  Now once Bin-Laden has nuclear weapons he will strike at three targets and you can quote me on it. These three targets will be Riyadh, Moscow, and Washington DC.  Riyadh because Bin-Laden holds that Saudi royals responsible for allowing the infadels to remain in the holy land. He is royally pissed off about that and has been stepping up efforts in Saudi Arabia to overturn the government and move it towards fundamentalism. They are already close to getting their way as the Saudi Royals have at best a precarious hold on power. So we can safely assume that is one of his prime targets. If he gets them the whole of the middle east will essentially fall into Muslim Fundamentalism.  Moscow he will attack because it is a relatively soft target and frankly Bin-Laden has even much more deeply rooted hatred of them than even the US. It will be revenge there. Plus the Chechans need the help and they are brothers in arms with the Muslims.  Washington DC is obvious. If he were detonate a nuke here we would surely fall into great disarray. We may not fall...but guaranteed our way of life will be over for a long long time and we will have serious problems for a lot of time.  Now the Bush administration will say that we can detect these weapons coming in, or hell any administration would say they could stop it. Well the plane fact is we can't detect nuclear weapons coming into the nation whether by cargo plane, ship, container, really anyway. The reason is because when you take the material and make it suitable for a weapon you essentially make it very stable (you don't want it being jossled and just blowing up) so it is really stable, which when stable like that it doesn't give off much free radiation. Also the weapons are also somewhat shielded for the protection of the people that have to handle them.  You can't detect them because they don't give off much radiation and as such attempting to detect them is pretty much impossible.   So if they were to get their hands on nukes there is no way we can actually protect against them getting here unless we lock down tight and frankly that is not in the same interest of freedom.   So we have some choices to make. Mark my words it is going to be hard over the next few years not withstanding whomever as president. All we can hope for is that we will not have a reactionary president that will make things worse and instead have one that will keep his head and make good sound decisions.  When the attack happens how will we respond. Under Bush we would declare nuclear war most definitely. We cannot do that because of the protections that are built into the Russian and our system of nuclear arsenals. We launch one off they launch one, basically locking us into a nuclear war that may not be able to be stopped. It is left over MAD (mutually assured destruction) protections built into the system. We may not intend to target Russian targets but their systems are not designed well enough to determine that for sure and they might launch on the fear that they are being attacked.  Regardless if we do attack the middle east with Nuclear Weapons and Russia does not repond we will still be screwing ourselves hardcore because like it or not we need the oil from the region for a time before we can transform into a hyrdrogen economy.   All of this is speculation of coarse...but I feel it is the most likely scenario that we are looking at and however you look at it it just looks bad for everyday americans and the common people of the world.   I hope I am wrong but I fear I am not.  May we all come out ok in the end...may we elect someone other than Bush so hopefully we won't retaliate with nuclear weapons making the situation worse for us all.

252,252,1476382,1,33,"        My Trio   reprinted: January 10th:  I suppose  Time Magazine's   Joel Stein  is an  urlLink okay kind of guy . I've never met him. He seems to have a  bit  of a wit, however  dry , for someone who works at  Time Magazine , the world's capitol of gravitas  and all that . In the end, though, there is nothing wrong with Joel Stein that a robust  multivitamin  couldn't remedy. But what was he thinking when  Trio TV  gave him the  urlLink gig of a lifetime ? I mean, who wants to watch endless hours of  Battle of the Network Stars ?  I mean,  seriously , who even watched Battle of the Network stars back then, when  Telly Savalas  and  Gabe Kaplan  had  juice  and ruled the roost? Not  me : and I was ever the hip 6 year old with emergent media antennae outstretched towards the avant garde world of  urlLink Schoolhouse Rock's Figure Eight  song on the melancholy of infinity and  urlLink The Land of the Lost .   Now, If  Laura Zalaznick  of Trio Tv called  The Corsair  tommorrow (call me, Laura, call ...  me  ...) and asked: What low budget high quality shows would you program for Trio TV? Remember, we only have a fraction of the network budgets, but we want high quality. I would say: Laura,  have you ever read my blog? I am all about low budget high quality.    Anyhoo : These are some of my picks:   Dummy .  urlLink Gritty 70s drama  of urban social decline -- thanks,  Ed Koch !  Asshole ! Back in the Koch day, NYC was all pimps with straightrazors and greaser glue sniffing graffiti punks roaming the streets in search of ultraviolence. Koch turned NYC into a  Guns n Roses  video, with  Mr. Brownstone  creeping around Central Park in a raincoat with nothing on underneath! Get  this  plot, though, peeps:  LeVar Burton  plays a  deaf  and  dumb  mute who is framed for the death of a prostitute (Kuta Kinte, you are a  framed  man!). But will we get  justice  for the amiable host of  urlLink Reading Rainbow ?    Anyhoo : Will a young  Paul Sorvino  get him redemption when he cannot even communicate with his morose client? Or will 'Dummy' just become another urban statistic on the Koch street?  Despite the overall bleakness, this a very,  very  cool slice of social commentary.    Masterpiece Theater: Last of the Mohicans . No, not the cheesy  Michael Mann  MTV video with  Daniel Day Lewis  and  Madeline Stowe  overproduced romance to the lowest common denominator.  No , this one was the  real deal .  The French and Indian War , my little pomegranates. Colonial wars involving trappers and Native Americans dressed in coonskin and caribou, muskets at the ready. The Massachusetts Bay Colonizers  and what not . Dodgy alliances based on mutual interests, snow and the fate of North America -- we're talking  the French and Indian War,  people , work with me here . The  drama , fo' shizit. For some bizarre reason the Masterpiece Theater programs made in the 70s -- arguably the best programming of all time -- languish in someone's vault,  uncherished  and unsung. American history geek? (raises hand sheepishly)  Present .   Alice:  I've always wondered if this was a  comedy  or a  tragedy , or perhaps that significant 70s artistic construct, the (flexes fingers) 'dramedy.'  Single mom who sings Bradway showtunes working to support her kid in Arizona on diner tips.  Fuck ! It's a hard knock life.   I'd imagine that singing 'There's a New Girl In Town' ought to really get those coffee refil tips into the bathysphere out there in  Phoenix . I'm sure the serial killer truck drivers en route to the Pacific Northwest on one hours sleep, a thermos full of coffee, tweaking from the crank with a meat cleaver under the diner stool are really  up  and  around  to hearing broadway medley's a la Our Alice,  no ? 'How about a little Irving Berlin whilst I carve up the dingy broad' -- 'might I suggest a breathless version of  urlLink Marie from Sunny Italy ?'   Better yet ,  Alice Hyatt , thou repository of the standards of  urlLink The Great White Way , stick with Florence 'Flo' Castleberry's crafty  urlLink weltanshauung : a leathery-Southwestern oversexed outlook on truckstop flings and a pipin hot 'kiss my grits!' for the cheapskates.   Imagine  if that show were pitched  nowadays . Only  David Lynch  would know what to do with it. Without the laugh track, Alice could  easily  be an American drama drenched in pathos, like  Dreiser's   Sister Carrie  --only more chilling. Take away the laugh track, throw in some creepy Lynchian music, or maybe some  urlLink John Cage , and you've turned a dramedy into  Americana horror . In all likelihood, Alice would end up on the evening news having sung ill-advisedly some Mel Torme to a guy who insisted that he 'was not the one.'  Lil' Tommy would be shackin up with the crank smoking Vera faster than Mel could re-lard his pork chops or Flo could pitch woo in her mobile home. No ...  urlLink Alice doesn't live here anymore .  Don't even get us started on the great  Vic Tayback  banging the pick up bell with his spatula like the true character actor he was. Dating those seedy Phoenix chicks well past their expiration date. A diner owner is royalty in the A-Z, you better recognize! Americana horror is the genre. May  Mel Sharples  rest in a  urlLink greasy kind of peace .  Pink  uniforms, ah, Mel, read much  de Beauvoir ?  Just looking back I cannot believe I just wrote this much about Alice the tv show (holds his head in shame)   Rich Man Poor Man:  Observe  Nick Nolte  before the fermented grape robbed him of his marginal looks, then again,  there is charm in Nolte's  urlLink whiskey ravaged grim visage . If Nolte can be a star then so, dammit, can anyone. Earns props for  Teachers , slo.  He counts . In both North Dallas 40 and Teachers Nolte plays a disenchanted member of the middle america with his job. He was a Gephardt man before his time, methinks.   Poldark:   This cult British tv series is quite habit forming. Incredible. Just  urlLink incredible . A period piece that is a cross between  Wuthering Heights ,  the Mayor of Casterbridge  and  Le Liaisons Dangereuse  but with a compelling soap opera character at its heart. A guilty high quality pleasure. You get sucked in to this costume drama that is one part Danielle Steele and one part high art.   Assorted Good Times episodes:  Come on, you know you had a crush on  Wilona  ('and you too, Wilomena' said the archetypical corrupt pol,  Alderman Davis ) when you were kid, didn't you; or, if you were a girl,  Bookman the janitor  was your  long, cold drink of water .  What, you never saw a black man doing a John Wayne impression,  pilgrim ? And you know in your heart Wilona saved  Janet Jackson  from falling down that elevator shaft while trying to escape her mom who beat her with a hot iron just before she became Willis' girl, then  Cleo  on Fame, then the ill-starred Ms. deBarge.  Remember the episode where Michael gets crunk off some dodgy ghetto 'health tonic' (aka muscatel)  urlLink classic  ('Get Vita Brite and sleep tonight' ...*promptly passes out*).   Then there was the time Michael joined a gang and hid his jacket in the oven. Oh, what about the one where Thelma almost married this polygamist Nigerian cat.  Crazy ! What about that  pimpy  guy 'Lennay,' who always sold  hot  appliances from out of his coat. Classic. So was the episode when James has hypertension. So was ...  hey  ... was this  urlLink a comedy or what ?   Cinema Paradiso . The best work of art on the subject of friendship I've ever encountered. A glorious film.   urlLink Fellini's Satyricon . A pagan work. Un-be- fucking -lievable: creativity on a galactic scale. The Rablasian Fellini walks us through Roman antiquity as he imagines it, crossed with highbrow science fiction sequences of an imagined future. There can never be anyone as Felliniesque as Fellini. The soundtrack alone is mindblowing.   The Big Blue Marble:  My favorite show as a kid,  if you must know .   Carl Sagan's Cosmos:   Okay, so in the madcap world of astrophysics  urlLink Sagan's hypotheses are probably all outmoded already . Right? So  what ? So is  Ptolemy's Almagest , and yet I still read it in college and gained benefit. The provocative thinking is worth another looksie; and, of course, worthy of more questions in light of our current data. This series was  the bomb ! (looks around sheepishly, then raises hand, 'question: who is the  PBS  geek'?) Classics are never outmoded.    urlLink Chespirito . This show was a mystery to me: Why would a grown Latin man want to go on tv dressed like a bumble bee with a big 'CH' affixed to his paunch. Subtitle it and put it on Trio; I'd watch it just to clarify a childhood mystery. Why is everyone else laughing but me on this one? We'd all like to know what the people on that endless laugh track find so funny.   urlLink Stoned, the Afterschool Special with Scott Baio . 'Super Stoned Jack,' was the scariest introduction that most of us had to the world of the sweet leaf. Sensimila? Not if you have any sensibilities! If I were  stoned  I would never go out in a row boat on some grey and greasy river. Well, certainly not after seeing this little chestnut. Put it on Trio so we can all laugh at the 'reefer madness.' Just say  yes  to the Farah Fawcett haired Felicity. But I'm sure skeevy New York Times writer  Neill Strauss  will.   Fame the TV Series : Why are there not repeats on  VH1  of this show already? When you say low budget and high quality I think ..  right here's where you start paying for it ... with pain ... and sweat . The show of young, artistic people struggling for their moment to shine is about as American as it gets. Whatever happened to that sexy cello player who wouldn't give anyone the time of day,  urlLink Lori Singer . I was all about the emotional cellist Lori Singer back in the day.   Cries and Whispers  by  Ingmar Bergman . If Black Stallion is the most beautifully shot film, then this is number two. All natural lighting. Bergman uses a fade to red to seperate scenes, mimicking the inner membrane of our eyelids. About as fucking intense as art can get. And halfway through this film about communication and treachery and time past, Bergman dissolves a reconcilliation scene with a Bach Sarabande in the most mysterious manner imaginable.    Schoolhouse Rock:   That Figure Eight . Mysterious, melancholy and mathematically instructional. Time will never again be so mundane. A strong influence on  The Corsair's  childhood.   The Black Stallion:  Those fabulous Copollas! This is perhaps the most beautiful filmed movie ever.   The Gore Vidal-Bill Buckley Debate-Fight  It was in the heart of the 60s: the polarized political center of the 60s. The left and the right clash violently  on national television . In the  news division  of a  respectable network .  Fuck!  A  classic . I just finished reading Vidal's Burr, BTW.  Excellent . And of course Buckley's role as Grandfather of the American movemenet is secure. For a moment, our two leading intellectuals of our two political polarities went at it in a bareknuckled intellectual fistfight. Not since  urlLink Burr shot Hamilton dead  has there been so much political drama in The Republic.   Woody Allen's Teleplay:  Don't Drink the Water .  One of the  urlLink most interesting  experiments on television ever.  Woody Allen  directs and writes a teleplay starring  Michael J Fox  and the kid who played  Blossom . Shaky handheld camera follows a grown Michael J. Fox as he slowly becomes involved with a bright but much younger woman. How the fuck did this get on American and not Parisian tv? Aren't we supposed to be puritainical? Did Woody Allen have so much juice back in the day that he could put on pedophilic Americana on network tv? Does the story sound familiar?  Actually  the story is tame, and inventive and very, very arty.   Kramer vs. Kramer.  The first dramatic and fully articulated statement of the Baby Boomers achieving adulthood.  A film of the first water. Young married couple breaks apart. They become two seperate people post sexual revolution. Wife leaves shallow workaholic husband and baby. Goes out West. Comes back revitalized. In the meantime, shallow husband defined by his work, like an Eisenhower-era man, like--probably--his father changes,  grows . Welcome to 1978, motherfucker.   Husband fights custody. Bach and Vivaldi weave in and out of drama that takes place, it seems, amidst the most poignant colors of Autumn in Central Park.   And the courtroom scene where Meryl Streep slowly dissolves into tears offset by forced composure as Hoffman's lawyer vivisects her irresponibility -- her feminism, her 1978ness -- are among the best goddamned acting you ever will see. Kramer versus Kramer is as good as film gets.  Okay, so those are some of my Trio picks. And you have to admit it is a hell of a lot better than  Battle of the Network Stars .

As always,  urlLink Dick Morris has some wise thoughts  on the Democrat convention (and, quite possibly,  urlLink some acute positions for the hookers  in Boston):   'The enraged left has to see this weeks gathering in Boston as its opportunity to respond to Bushs pre-emotion of the national stage in the wake of Sept. 11. At last, its paranoid suspicions and reasonable doubts alike can be aired before a national prime-time audience. No longer confined to venues like Michael Moore movies, Democratic orators can give their version of recent history and attack what they see as the seminal mistakes of the Bush response to terror.   'So the impetus for a negative convention will be strong and widely felt. Like water that has accumulated behind a dam, Bushs partisan opponents will want to lash out and bring the president down.   'But this blood lust can only destroy Kerrys chances of making this convention the springboard he needs. Negatives dont work at conventions. The most negative in recent memory was the 1992 Republican conclave where  urlLink speaker after speaker thrashed both Clintons  usually aiming at the wrong one and failed to produce any gain for their candidate as he sought re-election.'

Night, who is known for his distinctive artistry as well as for bucking mainstream Hollywood, selected a look from the not-yet-available spring 2005 Z Zegna collection, ensuring an independent look for the evening. He arrived on the red carpet wearing a black jacquard slim-fitting suit with a crisp, white open collar shirt from new and fashion-forward Z Zegna. Brody also appeared in Zegna in a prcis black suit and gray button-down, choosing to top off his look with a red silk tie ? a nod to Night?s use of the color in his film as the symbol of evil.&nbsp; In fact, the outdoor premiere scrapped the traditional (and evil) red carpet in favor of a yellow one. 'The Village' was recreated in the park while people dined and had cocktails under the moonlight.

David Havennar , 41, was charged with battery for smacking girlfriend  Nancy Monico  in the ribs with the gator, who lived in a bathtub in Havennar's Port Orange home, according to the below Volusia County Sheriff's Office report. Monico told deputies that she did not know why Havennar had an alligator in his bathtub, but claimed her beau was 'torturing' the reptile. However, an examination of the reptile--which was seized by state wildlife officials--showed no signs of abuse. Monico, on the other hand, suffered minor injuries to her lip, legs, and back area, according to investigators. For his part, Havennar claimed that Monico started the 9 AM dustup when she 'bit him on the hand because she was mad about being out of alcohol.''   The rough patches of any relationship can be lubricated, I suppose,&nbsp;with a lusty sip of the old 'Budweiser.' But,  The Corsair  imagines,&nbsp;Monico probably didn't 'cook up the possum and fixins' to his liking.&nbsp;Monico might even possibly have been 'messing with his crank,' &nbsp;meriting the&nbsp;lamentable minor injuries to the 'back area,' so skillfully described in the police report.&nbsp;And, of course, the  urlLink coup de grace ,  urlLink in his mugshot , this paragon of manliness&nbsp;is not even wearing a shirt.

Asked about the last time hed voted, Mr. Combs, wearing sunglasses and a dark sports jacket over a 'Vote or Die' T-shirt, confessed that he last entered a voting booth and pulled the lever in 2000. Mr. Combs stood at a podium in Kimmel Auditorium at N.Y.U., surrounded by red-white-and-blue balloons in front of an audience that half-expected him to launch his own run for office.   'When queried whether he voted in city elections, Mr. Combs said, 'No.' An awkward silence ensued; the microphone squealed. Could he elaborate on why? 'To be honest, Im justI was just as disenfranchised as the younger disenfranchised voters,' he stammered, before the smooth-talking salesman kicked in. 'Its just recently, in 2000, that I started to educate myself and understand the way the system works. So thats what makes this thing so much more relevant, because Im not talking from the outside. I understand a lot about how young people feel and how minorities feel; we feel that the system doesnt work. But I cant just sit back and complain about it, you knowI can do something about it. So I dont have a long-lasting record history of voting, but I do have a long-lasting record of communicating and motivating and energizing and synergizing young people and, you know, Im just like them.

And he is now refusing to advertise again until further notice. 'It is correct that the Armani Group has removed the New York Times newspaper (not the New York Times Magazine) from its advertising plan,' a spokesperson for the company told The Daily. 'This decision has been taken as a result of the existence of a persistent and significant philosophical difference with the newspaper's fashion desk. We have no other comment to make at this time.' The review, which appeared in the July 4 issue of the paper, read as follows: 'The creative possibilities of Italian fashion were once clearly synonymous with the name of Giorgio Armani. When exactly, one wonders, did that stop being the case? It is not so much that talk about corporate succession has damaged the image as the designer approaches 70. It is not that people have forgotten Mr Armani's profound contributions to fashion design.

266,266,1476382,1,33,"        My Eight Favorite Curmudgeons   Has there ever been an African-American  curmudgeon ? I mean, it's not as if  taste  is a matter exclusive to white men, or even  metrosexuals  purely. Well, if there are not, put me down as the  world's first African American curmudge .   And in that good old   list-y  curmudgeonly fashion, allow me to proffer up my list of the  eight  best (why  ten ? ten is such a  bourgois  convention *sips Cutty Sark* returns snarkily again to blog):   Kurt Anderson , the Elder Brother of the NY Media Corridor is a curmudgeon, to be sure. I interviewed with Kurt for a job at the late, great  Inside.com  --  didn't get it .  Alas; no hard feelings. At the time I had just been a research editor at the then oh-so-hot  Silicon Alley Reporter , and immediately following, had just been installed as Editor in Chief of a small consumer quarterly called,  urlLink MacDirectory . Kurt started off the interview by asking, with only a trace of irony, 'so ... what's  MacDirectory ?' A smile played on his lips. Oh  snap ! I got dissed by the Elder Brother of the New York Media! Then again: How cool is that?   Before that, I had met him briefly as the factckecker on  urlLink New York Magazine's cyber 60 issue . There I saw Kurt, the editor, at, like, 11 pm on a Thursday night as I was trying to validate all this massive data for that issue; I was pretty frazzled as, by then, I was in my mid 20s and in the whole party all night work all day thing. Kurt made me work like a  Bonnie Fuller  minion on that one. Ah, well, whatever does not kill one ... Nietzsche  and all that .  Kurt has always about him the air of  high seriousness , which makes it appear as if what he's doing at the moment is the most important thing in the world. No doubt Steven Brill, who eventually purchased Inside, was caught on  that  disorienting roller coaster. Kurts study of sociology at Harvard plays a great part in his social smartness.   Kurt is the  Platonic eidos  of smart as well as healthily ironic,with a cultivated aesthetic eye and, of course, everyone wants to work with him for precisely those reasons.  Half of you probably found this choice   interesting , while the other half are scrolling furiously down the screen looking at my other picks whispering, 'thanks for sharing,  Ron .' Hey, curmudgeons are  notoriously self centered .  My  second  curmudgeon is  Gore Vidal , whose book  Burr  I have just finished after three days of sleep deprivation.  American History  geek that I am, I could not put that shizit down and am now, hallucinating, posting this blog before the redcoats come to do a  urlLink Crispus Attucks  on my fine self. And so it is with ink stained hands that I tip my Corsair tricorn pirate hat to Vidal.   The Corsair  had a brief phone encounter with this honorable man of letters. In 1995, while an intern at  The Nation ,  Christopher Hitchens  asked me to fax a story on  Marty Peretz  of the New Republic to  Gore Vidal . Gore Vidal's fax was busy do I called him up to tell him it was coming through. In the background I heard voices and music, apparently Gore Vidal was having a party at his palazzo. ' Pronto !' he yelled into the phone, sounding a little sloshed. I told him what was coming, he politely turned on the fax, and that was it. My brush with Vidal.  At that moment my desire to be a writer in the manner of Vidal was strengthened one hundred fold. I wanted to dash off essays  Montaigne -style on Art and Politics.  It is unfortunate that Vidal has, of late, taken to employing such  inflamatory  rhetoric during this tense period in American history (note: his assertion that  George Bush  knew of the 9-11 attacks before hand ...  yikes!).  The problem with Gore Vidal is that he was born rich and has lived his life where every utterance is taken as God's word, among idolizing students, servants, Presidents ( Kennedy ,  Hillary ?), and socialites ( Jackie O ,  Eleanor Roosevelt , even  Joanne Woodward ). He is for all intensive purposes the eccentric Southern Patriarch straight out of  William Faulkner . We should take him at his word on Art and with a grain of salt on politics.  My third favorite curmudgeon is  Christopher Hitchens . I worked as Hitchens' intern at  The Nation  in 1995, and, over the years, he has helped me immensely. Frankly, it pisses me off when former interns or collegues attack him for his perfectly principled -- though I disagree with him -- stance on eradicating dictators through pre-emptive action.    Hitchens can drink . I remember one event -- a tradition -- in which his intern is taken out to lunch. In a restaurant off of Grammercy Park, talking of classical literature and US defense spending, we drank  prodigiously . Yes,  The Corsair  got his drink on with Hitchens and his old college buddy. We also briefly discussed the country of my descent, Uganda, which was a British colony, and it's President, a family friend,  Museveni , who, although not a 'small d democrat,' we all agreed was  good  for the emerging nation.   The drink bill was greater than the food bill. Afterwards, in the summer afternoon, I tried, weaving through traffic, to make my way home ('no intern has ever made it back to the office after a Hitch lunch, don't even try,' said the Intern coordinator). It was  harrowing . Several times  The Corsair  nearly lost his boozy life but I made it home and fondly remember my time working with Hitchens, a truly generous man. I remember my girlfriend wondering  what the hell  happened to me to be so drunk in the afternoon: did I get fired?  Next up is  Taki Theodoropoulos  whom I met at  Elaine's  when I was in my mid 20s. I won a contest for  Top Drawer  section of the NY Press, back when the NY Press was relevant. The contest was for Man of the Year and I nominated  urlLink UN arms inspector Scott Ritter , who, alas, turned out to be an  urlLink internet child predator . God, how fucking  embarrasing !  At Elaine's Taki introduced me to  Elaine Kaufman , the owner of that media joint,  Chris Buckley , who's dad almost went to my alma mater, he told me, and the arrogant  Michael Mailer  , of whom nothing ought to be said.   Taki comes off  very  strongly in his columns as  Eurosnobby  and to the right of Pinochet, but, in real life, he is quite a character, very warm and fun loving. Like Hitchens, he loves a drink.   Taki was terribly funny that day, making some very risque jokes about  Bill Clinton , who, at the time, was going through Monica-gate and good cigars. Taki is also deeply literate, with a working knowledge of  Pindar  as well as  Aeschylus , and all manner of Greek literature, Word War II arcana, history and choice tidbits of media gossip from the DC sector to Manhattan. And Taki is generous to a fault, having paid for the whole goddam party out of his own very deep Greek shipping magnate pockets. I'm talking many many thousands kept the party boozed up and in good food. Poor little Greek boy, indeed.  Next up is  Dick Cavett , who I am sure you will be  glad to know  I have never met, but I wish I had. Cavett was liberal cool before liberal cool was even that -- and even now that it  isn't . He is a Master Coversationalist, able to discuss  urlLink the bicameral mind theory  as well as mediate the literary feud of Gore Vidal and Norman Mailer where  urlLink Mailer headbutted Vidal .  Pure 70s conversation: keep on truckin, Dick.  There is agreat line that Cavett is said to have made at a very pretty young African American woman who was waiting to attand a taping of his show. Cavett asked her her name. 'Toi,' said she; 'is that your  name ,' he deadpanned, 'or your  function ?'   urlLink Fran Liebowitz  is another formidable curmudgeon. Although she once remarked in  Metropolitain Life  that black men have a propensity to Strawberry Wine (who loves ya, Fran, who-loves- you ?), she was  very  very funny in her day.    urlLink John Simon of New York Magazine  is a curmudgeon who would have to be invented if he didn't indeed already exist. Once while at  The Nation  under an unbreakable deadline where I had to verify the spelling and history of an obscure filmmaker I was in dire straights. Who ya gonna call:  John Simon ! After flattering him on an article he wrote in some Scandanavian Literary Review that I had actually read (he replied, graciously, 'thank you ... thank you ... you are probably the only one who has read it.'), he helped me out --  gratis .   Most writers respond to such a request by saying, 'well, what do  I  get out of it.' *coughs* Fox News' Roger Friedman*coughs*' But  not Simon , who rules Broadway with a nimble yet caustic pen that sports acid for ink.   And when he is not loving to hate something on Broadway in the pages of newly bought New York Magazine, he is writing --  prolifically  -- on art, culture, literature, opera, books ...  anything . And he does it well.  Excedingly  well. God bless John Simon, our forgotten gem.  Then there is  urlLink Sandra Bernhard . She is strangely sexy and sad and acidic in her wit all at the same time. I saw her sachaying once across the way on Ludlow Street several years ago before Max Fish's lost its social cachet. There was something so touching ... so existential ... about her.   She was  beautiful , wearing a sleek number on her body not unlike Olive Oyl, sardonic smirk evident, aristocratic street toughness oozing out of every pore. God, she looked so fucking hot in a way that I cannot explain adequately.  Hollywood has not been kind to her, despite her gutsy performance in the King of New York, and neither has  Madonna , but they have, it appears, made up for all intensive purposes.  Why can't she get the jump off?   So there are my fave curmudgeons, not an African American among them, honorable mentions to  Margaret Cho , who is young, but on her way to the top drawer, and  Carrie Fisher , who has evolved from  Princess Leia  (sp?) into a snarky chronicler of life in Los Angeles, what city of glitz and plastic.

with ink stained hands that I tip my Corsair tricorn pirate hat to Vidal The Corsair had a brief phone encounter with this honorable man of letters In while an intern at The Nation Christopher Hitchens asked me to fax a story on Marty Peretz of the New Republic to Gore Vidal Gore Vidal's fax was busy do I called him up to tell him it was coming through In the background I heard voices and music apparently Gore Vidal was having a party at his palazzo Pronto he yelled into the phone sounding a little sloshed I told him what was coming he politely turned on the fax and that was it My

267,267,1476382,1,33,"        Vanitas Vanitatum, Omnia Vanitas   'Laughter is mad, and reckless mirth-/ What does she in this weary earth?/ Should Wealth, or Fame, our Life employ,/ Death comes, our labour to destroy,' writes  Ann Bronte  in  urlLink Vanitas Vanitatum, Omnia Vanitas . And the same could be said of inveterate namedropper and  urlLink status seeker  extraordinare  urlLink James Lipton  of  urlLink Inside the Actors Studio  ( okay , *skittish* so maybe I know a little bit about this topic, my little pommies, as that little -- makes broad quotation gestures with his fingers -- 'interview with myself' thingie wasn't  the best  idea I've ever come up with, *blushes*).   urlLink Joanna and Alex  of the very cool Two-Twenty.net  urlLink put me in my place over my vanity , as did several others via email. I'm properly chastened. If I'm gonna throw down the snark, I should have a tough enough skin to take a bit of a bitchslapping now and then, as well. What was it  Matt Dillon  said in  Drugstore Cowboy  about  urlLink the therapeutic qualities of getting your ass kicked ? So, allow me to redeem my name on the subject of self promotion.  So, let's get  off me  and back  on to   James Lipton . (apologies, that was a nasty little piece of imagery I just laid on you; fucking  disgusting , actually)  Of  Lipton , who we now  presently mount  with vigor ( sorry , couldn't resist), let us say that one  Robert Wilonski  of the  urlLink Dallas Observer  once sagely wrote, ' James Lipton  is so obsequious, it's astonishing the man does not conduct his interviews from his subjects' anal cavities ( ed note : this emerging theme is not my fault). The host of Bravo's hysterical, oddly riveting  Inside the Actors Studio  never misses an opportunity to suck up to the famous and talented who deign to accept his invitation.'  And yet the  New York Times  doesn't appear to think so, as in tommorrow's Sunday Times Magazine  Edward Levine  interviews him in the  urlLink 'DOMAINS' section , where Levine's  dough  is earned the hard way.   Gargantuan  was the name dropping going on at that  little tea party . Since I was called on my bull, let me be the bull rattling the china at that pleasant Times Magazine interview; allow me to bring some  urlLink Minoan chaos to Europa's ordered walk in the meadow . And so, on the principle of 'takes one to know one' we -- the  shamed  author of the infamous 'interview with myself' -- will  grade  Our Man Lipton, on how good he is at self promotion. Edward Levine's Lipton interview begins thusly:  ' Workout : I do Pilates. I actually trained with  urlLink Joseph Pilates  himself and his wife, Clara. This was in the mid-1960's, and it was a thing for dancers then. When Joe died, a group of us bought his gym for his widow. I still do Pilates downstairs, all the mat work. I don't need an instructor. I could teach it myself. Not that I look thin these days. I sit too much and eat too much.'  (diva-like whisper) He doesn't need an instructor; he could teach it himself. (with this,  The Corsair  presently resumes his very sorry indeed 'snarky-growly'  urlLink Lou Grant  impression with light touch of Ugandan accent about the 'o's').  The Corsair  gives Lipton an  A  regarding his 'gym' grade on the self-promoting art of talking publicly about the fact that -- yes -- you  do indeed  work out. The only fault contained therein is that he didn't talk publicly about working out in front of a  mirror , or,  better yet , a window facing out towards the public on, say, the Lower East Side or the Meatpacking District or even out in Hells Kitchen, where the biker gangs don't take kindly to that sort of thing. Now,  that  would have been  urlLink de trop , but not  too  trop, I think. The grade  could  have fallen to an  A-Minus  had he simply said he used Pilates, which is, quite frankly, a little 2003, but Lipton recounted a clever little anecdode of good times shared with  Joseph Pilates , or 'Joe', as Lipton intones gravely, hinting at mortality, making us all seem  just a little bit  more uncool in that world that Lipton, and Lipton  alone , so excellently occupies. Riding on that 'Joementum,' buying the gym is a bit much, almost too put on, but it worked -- mainly because he can buy gyms for grieving widows. Very  urlLink Conrad Bain  as  urlLink Mr. Drummond  in Diffr'nt Strokes.   Levine continues in the interview:  ' Favorite household chore : I do very few things in the world well, but one of the things I do well is frame and hang pictures. I am most fastidious about my pictures. I go around straightening them all day.'   The Corsair  grades Lipton a C on that one. A solid C. The modesty rings false, bro, and I should know. This is the same thing I went and done did with that interview of myself. This is bigger than the both of us, Jamesy (slaps around a sloppily constructed hand made effigy of James Lipton):  It's not about the mundane you  ... it's about the people you know (grabs effigy and points out well beyond the fourth wall of comedy, and towards 'the stars' with a 'nurtured in the wilderness' look) and all that powerful juju that you spout out on tv that involve  them  ... do it for the children, James. That you straighten pictures is not as interesting as  who  is in those pictures, James. Who, James, (shakes a voodoo effigy of Lipton, looks confused)  who ... ?!  The interview goes onwards:  ' Pre-show ritual : We shoot on Monday nights. I will already have done two weeks' research. Then Friday morning through Monday afternoon I am incommunicado. My wife and I will dine and talk, but those four days are sacrosanct. I am in my study preparing my questions. I print out my blue cards at around 4 on Monday afternoon.'   Erm , a B. He communicated ' urlLink incommunicado .' Which ... we like,   I guess.  Somewhat.  Next:  ' Post-show ritual : Often the guest and I have dinner afterward. I don't eat before the show. We go to  Elaine's , and we eat and talk until 1 or 2 in the morning. We did it with  Harrison Ford  and  Mike Myers ;  Charlize Theron  and her mother; and  John Travolta .'   Fuck, an A-Plus  grand slam, Lipsky. We can forgive the unfortunate reference to  urlLink John Travolta  and  urlLink Mike Myers  because through that thicket he leads us, gently, by the hand, to a tasty slice o' A-Listers, like:  urlLink Charlize Theron  and  urlLink Harrison Ford  jammed into the same thought with  urlLink Elaine's .  Shmears .  Next:  ' Favorite outfit : My wife has to put me together. Sartorially, I am a disaster. I have no taste. I am from Michigan. I am a Midwesterner with Midwestern taste.'  Hmmm. We will admit that the red-state thing should have fucked with his  GPA . But he was  bold  about it. That Midwest comment so  falsely articulated  radiated just the  right  amount of authenticity. It reminded me of my Grandfather's homebrewed bannana beer back in Uganda.  James Lipton , seems to be shouting out to the indifferent, Sartrian universe, that he is  not  afraid of his roots. Lipton is at one with his inner Americana. Although James is actually so Chardonnay -sipping-and-Brie-munching University-professor-blue-state-type that it hurts, he's  not afraid  to admit he was born in the heartland, most likely munching a cheeseburger and clutching at a gun as he emerged triumphantly from the afterbirth, crawling towards Tinseltown with stars in his eyes. And although he has risen to the heights that only  urlLink John Travolta's jet  can presume to attain, James is still 'down' with  urlLink the common man.  And mentioning the old ball-and-chain, the long-suffering Mrs. Lipton added  depth  to his little performance of self. I'll give an controversial A to this 'revelation', paced very well in the story.  Again:  ' Luxury he can't live without : Our home in  Bridgehampton , without question. It is my oasis, my salvation.'  Oh, A, buddy boy.  An A answer if there ever was one, Mr. Oasis (smiles admiringly); Mr. Salvation (taps effigy on the back). Bridgehampton is  not  the Hamptons, and that's good, bacause the Hamptons is filled with Soprano's-type-brokers who usually snack on strippers, but come Friday after Memorial Day, try, in vain, to munch on that late twentysomething  Manolo Blahnik -type weekend gold digger (fake waves) that is way --  oh, so very way  -- out of their league. The Hamptons is  so over . But the  urlLink artistic-literary Bridgehampton  is forever. It is the new  urlLink P-Town .   More!   ' Car : A Mercedes S.U.V. I love that car. I'm not a P.C. person. I sit there royally in my S.U.V. and never think about the gas consumption.'  (BZZzzzz)  Ahhh  *all disappointed*, sorry about that, James, but we have a wondeful consolation prize for you backstage: a  B-Plus  at best. A Mercedes SUV would have been an A-Plus answer back in 2002, but the war, the WMDs ... uhhh,  no . A Toyota  urlLink Prius  was the answer we were looking for, James. So sorry.  ' Oscar-night plan : I'm going to the  Vanity Fair party in L.A . I went last year. If you are not nominated, and obviously I am not, the worst thing in the world to have to sit through is an awards ceremony. So I watched it at the party.   An  A . It would have been an A-Plus but for the fact that James forgot to mention  urlLink Graydon Carter . In fact, I think it is actually trademarked as the 'GraydonCarterOscarParty (TM)' -- or something along those lines. Still, this was a respectable showing for a self-proclaimed Midwesterner.  ' Biggest shock of his life : I wrote the book and lyrics for a musical called  urlLink 'Sherry, ' which opened and closed in 1967. In the aftermath, the orchestrations disappeared, but they turned up in the Library of Congress in 2000. On Feb. 24,  Angel Records  is bringing out an album of the show with  Nathan Lane ,  Carol Burnett ,  Bernadette Peters ,  Tommy Tune  and  Mike Myers .'   Nathan Lane  and  Bernadette Peters  are so Theater royalty. A Solid  A-Plus .  Tommy Tune  may have been a bit much, though, but I'm not buying that line of argument.    Anyhoo , Lipton goes on, even doing the Proust questionaire, saying his favorite word is  honor . Hmmm.  Not bloody likely , I'm afraid, try: FAME, or any derivative with similar connotation .... but check the interview out anyway  urlLink here .

277,277,1476382,1,33,"        A Little of the Old In and Out    In : The penultimate Soprano's episode for the penultimate Sopranos season is on Sunday night ( The Corsair  rubs his hands together and chuckles softly in anticipation).   Molte buono!  And so it begins (munches on zeppolli). As  urlLink the HBO website describes the episode , 'With the feds pulling a new trump card,  urlLink Adriana  ponders her options.  urlLink Tony B.  unloads some heavy baggage on  urlLink Tony , and vice-versa;  urlLink Johnny Sack  makes Tony an offer he can refuse; and Tony offers Carmela a deal to make her real-estate dreams come true. Don't miss the all new episode 'Long Term Parking' on Sunday May 23rd at 9PM ET.'  ( The Corsair  digs into a plate of pounds of shrimp scampi)  So, does that mean  Adriana  gets whacked,  Ninja style ? Or does she convince  Christufuh  to go into witness protection or what? What heavy baggage? Were the Tony's victims of child abuse when they were younger? Is that what made them the men they are today,  capish ? ( The Corsair  chows down on veal marsala, making wild Mediterranean hand gestures)   Out :  Senator John Kerry , he of the  urlLink Gilbert Stuart-like  crafted face, delaying his acceptance of the Democratic nomination for strategic reasons.  Bad fucking move.    Already the Repubican spin machine is playing this little fiasco as another example of the flip floppy Taxachuesetts liberal's indecision and, quite frankly,  lack of a core . Thirty year old bideo tape of an idealist Kerry against the war on Dick Cavett does not an exciting man make. Kerry has not yet found the G-Spot of the Democratic Party, and The Party is getting restless and unsatisfied. Why have a convention without the traditional 'happy ending'?  The Republicans have a point . The Conventions are geared like a NASA mission, with the candidate  launched  -- officially and with great fanfare -- on the last day,  in prime time ; a culminating speech without accepting the nomination is, to be sure, a zipless fuck.  urlLink The NY Times observes :  'If he goes through with the idea, Mr. Kerry would still give a culminating speech amid the traditional pomp and circumstance of his party's convention here in late July. But he would formally accept his nomination at about the time President Bush does at the Republican convention in New York in early September, aides said.  'Such a move could offset what otherwise might be a severe financial disadvantage for Mr. Kerry under the arcane rules for the public financing of campaigns. Both he and Mr. Bush are planning to use federal funds in their general-election campaigns, and thus will be limited to spending $75 million apiece on television commercials and other expenses in the fall.   'But that spending cap kicks in at the moment a candidate is nominated by his party or on Sept. 1, whichever comes first, according to federal election officials. And with the Republican convention pushed back this year until Aug. 30 to Sept. 2, Mr. Bush has five more weeks in which he can spend an unlimited amount of money, while Mr. Kerry has to make his $75 million allowance last that much longer.  ''Think about it,' said one Democratic strategist who spoke on condition of anonymity. 'You're John Kerry. You're raising more money than any Democratic candidate ever has, you've just this last month out-fund-raised a sitting president of the United States who's a record-breaking fund-raiser himself, and despite all of that, the clock is ticking on when you can spend that money, and you know that for more than a month, you're not going to be able to use it. It would be self-crippling not to keep raising money as long as you can.''  It would also be crippling, we cannot fail to note, if the Republicans began to attack Senator erry, who, increasingly, is allowing his campaign to appear  stagnantly Al Goresque  while he is out whoring for his campaign lucre. The Republican spin machine can characterize Kerry as being entirely a creature of strategy and compromise and, we must not fail to note, however regrettably, ' urlLink The French Connection .'

( The Corsair  dry heaves)  'The flamboyant singer was forced to cancel a series of dates on the band's US tour earlier this year because of health problems.  'Hawkins told  The Sun : 'I had a hiatus hernia and acid reflux. Basically, there's a sphincter inside your throat, as well as up your bottom. It's supposed to control how much acid is let up into your throat.  ''But mine was broken so my stomach was spitting acid into the throat. It was literally burning my voice up.'  ( The Corsair  nods, knowingly, mouthing the words  'that yodel' )  'Doctors warned that if he didn't have treatment, he was in serious danger of losing his voice.  'The singer added: 'Doctors stuck a tube down my nose to measure the acidity. Three per cent is normal. They operate at 12%.  ''But I clocked a whopping 82%. It was one of the worst cases in medical history. I was taking indigestion tablets to stop it. But they weren't working. So I had to go through with the procedure.'  'Although his voice is now permanently cured, Justin has been left with marks from the operation.'  And we, who read this story, also have been left with marks, no less acute, though less visible.

machine is playing this little fiasco as another example of the flip floppy Taxachuesetts liberal's indecision and quite frankly lack of a core Thirty year old bideo tape of an idealist Kerry against the war on Dick Cavett does not an exciting man make Kerry has not yet found the G-Spot of the Democratic Party and The Party is getting restless and unsatisfied Why have a convention without the traditional happy ending The Republicans have a point The Conventions are geared like a NASA mission with the candidate launched officially and with great fanfare on the last day in prime time a culminating speech without accepting the nomination is to be sure a zipless fuck The NY Times observes If he goes through with the idea Mr Kerry would still give a culminating speech amid the traditional pomp and circumstance of his party's convention here in late July But he would formally accept his nomination at about the time President Bush does at the Republican convention in New York in early September aides said Such a move could offset what otherwise might be a severe financial disadvantage for Mr Kerry under the arcane rules for the public financing of campaigns Both he and Mr Bush are planning to use federal funds in their general-election campaigns and thus will be limited to spending million apiece on television commercials and other expenses in the fall But that spending cap kicks in at the moment a candidate is nominated by his party or on Sept whichever comes first according to federal election officials And with the Republican convention pushed back this year until Aug to Sept Mr Bush has five more weeks in which he can spend an unlimited amount of money while Mr Kerry has to make his million allowance last that much longer Think about it said one Democratic strategist who spoke on condition of anonymity You're John Kerry You're raising more money than any Democratic candidate ever has you've just this last month out-fund-raised a sitting president of the United States who's a record-breaking fund-raiser himself and despite all of that the clock is ticking on when you can spend that money and you know that for more than a month you're not going to be able to use it It would be self-crippling not to keep raising money as long as you can It would also be crippling we cannot fail to note if the Republicans began to attack Senator erry who increasingly is allowing his campaign to appear stagnantly Al Goresque while he is out whoring for his campaign lucre The Republican spin machine can characterize Kerry as being entirely a

284,284,1510754,1,24,"            Late Night Ramble: on love, truth, beauty, and understanding   Well now… after sleeping off my hangovers, taking down those damned trees and lights, and marveling at Dick Clark’s seeming immortality, I’m ready to get back to work. Consider this my first official post of the new year.  ...I know… ‘bout damn time :)   The following is part one in a four part series that I’m gonna try and bang out in a week. I’m usually up well past a reasonable hour and oftentimes I’m alone in front of a monitor or a television or a novel or some such thing. Invariably, my mind gets to wandering and I find myself lost. Most times the night ends with me shaking my head and going to bed. This time, however, I’ve decided to share a bit of that with you bastards. This first part is my take on love. Don't go expecting this to make sense... this is me strained through twilight and beer. This is [Dexter] after the witching hour... this is my unedited madness... Hold on to your gonads…    Part I - Love    On Love   I  if when you cook gulash(sp?)    and i, bleary-eyed,      stare and stare        at the soft          Camera dollies in slowly rIse of your neck siLhouetted by the stOVE lamp         cUt to medium shot and PLEASE take delight in    directing my own little pLAY     chuckling WITHal       Would you chastize ME?  II  In November freeze swarms of autumn leaves crack against the windshield in head-light drunk glory,  So contagious their abandon that cortex and testes  travel time to remember when  I took shape! between lines of antimony  and fell  A lash to the cold.  III   I saw your face  Etched in mist By the branches  Outside my window. An equation crawled  across my wall and divided into the null set.   --  Ram S.Iyer    I fall in love all the time. Hard. There’s really no rhyme or reason to it either (and I suspect that would make it easier to deal with). No certain look, no melodious voice, no athletic prowess or intellectual whatnots have been able to truly catch my eye in the beginning. It’s always some oddball thing. They way they chew their food, the way they pronounce a certain word (cabbage – long story), hell even some annoying things have a way of capturing my heart wholly and without the slightest hint of reason.   That isn’t to say that it’s love at first sight. In my opinion “love at first sight” is dramatic romantic bullshit that only happens in movies and cheap novels.   Nevertheless, however long it takes, I’m eventually smitten without hope of recovery – or so it seems at the time. Having been captured I am, thus, their slave – unbeknownst to them, of course. I spend damn near every waking hour in a semi-conscious daze. I fret endlessly on how I would express this wonderful and altogether insane feeling. I write secret poems and love letters. I look for idiotic ways to signal them that I’m interested. Hell, I even write dumb little love songs to go with my poetry. It’s sad really.   Alright – maybe that last part was a bit dramatic– but follow me.  I don’t do well. I make a huge and wildly unpredictable ass of myself. I break easily. My confidence leaves me and every moment with that person (who before was simply another person) is bliss/agony. I friggin’ stutter if you can imagine that. I’m barely myself. It’s as if some great and terrible fire has been started and I’m simultaneously warming myself by it and being consumed by it. And, what’s more, if I’m particularly unlucky, I am brought to the point where I reveal my affections.    (Shaking head) – That’s right – I tell them. It’s horrible.  For all the confident assertions, manly showboating, and downright asshole-ery I’m known for, at the end of the day, I’m a softy. Love, quite literally, makes me sick.   I’ve spent the brunt of my years mulling over just what love is and how it works. My motive wasn’t as noble or innocent as you might suppose. I did (and do) all this searching because I wanted a cure – badly. I want off of this damn love rollercoaster.  My questing has basically lead me to these two truths:  1)There’s not a damn thing I can do about it – falling in love I mean 2)Love was never intended to make any kind of sense and any search for such a thing is hopeless  I used to be afraid to label my feelings as “ LOVE ” – that frightening four-letter word. I’d reason that I hadn’t known the person long enough or that any number of other factors weren’t “just right”… that way it couldn’t possibly be “love”… it was “like”… or infatuation, or a crush, or whatever. Anything but love. Love takes years and years of cultivation. It doesn’t just HAPPEN… right?!   Boy was I ever wrong . (I hope you heard that, Don)   I came to find that my feelings were love. Infant stages, mind you, but love nonetheless. Similar to the way a baby is just as much a human being as an old man though they are wildly dissimilar…  terrible analogy, I know but follow me. In much the same way, my feelings for these folk were born out of something. No spontaneous generation mumbo-jumbo here… That love that I felt (and feel), like all love I suppose, was mothered by past experience and fathered by stimulation – what happened before meeting them combined with meeting them. That love is then nurtured by trust (mother’s milk), truth, compromise,. Etc. etc… you get me. I’m not saying that every time I get a hardon, it’s time to go ring shopping. I AM saying that it was and is love and that it’s one hell of a mindfuck.  I still wonder why it happens like it does for me. Every time I go off spilling my guts and come back empty handed I say, “What the hell is my problem? I knew better from the start not to go off at the mouth about ‘love’ unless I was sure that the feeling was mutual. What in the hell was I thinking?”. I know I’m not alone on this one. We’re encouraged to seek out love, to never give up until we have it, and (most importantly), to never let go. We’re drawn this wonderful picture of what love is and we buy it and hang it on our wall and swoon. We curl close to our pillows and dream about it. I guess in someway every one of us is either waiting for it or trying to maintain it.   But why?   Why do we believe in this madness? And, what’s more, when we discover the truth… when we find out that  love is the cure  and  the disease … why do we continue? Is it really worth it?  Maybe so. Perhaps it’s the hope of love as the ultimate panacea that keeps us questing regardless of what we believe to be our chances of success. It’s one thing to hope against nothing or to hope for the unlikely. It’s an entirely different thing to hope and seek after something many of us would believe that we’ll never have… more so something that we believe that we aren’t worthy of. THAT’S the kicker. Love hurts, it is nearly impossible to obtain, and we are, by our own estimations, unworthy… yet we pursue it nonetheless. Because even though it may be hopeless and even though we may be unworthy and even though it may drive us insane when we find it… the good of it - the filling of the hole within us all so to speak… the death of loneliness - is far too compelling.  Or maybe that’s bullshit. Maybe it’s way past my bedtime and I’ve had too much (or too little) to drink. Maybe love isn’t any more important than football or bourbon.  Maybe.  I do believe, however, that love is something that starts from within. That love for another isn’t pure if one doesn’t love oneself. And I believe also that love is true in different ways for everyone.  So what’s my truth? – love burns. As well it should! What good would love be if it was easily found? and when lost, if it could be recovered from in a night? Where’s the value in that? What would be the point of a quest if you never left home, never left your comfort zone, never suffered, never fell flat on your face, or never lost faith? What good is it if there is no stuggle? No trial by fire? I’ll tell you. Zero good. No good at all. Because without the struggle, without the heartbreak and the hopelessness, there can be no appreciation. When you get burned, you bet your sweet as that you’ll remember. And the bonus is that with all that burning comes purification. Hear me out.  Self love is something we don’t spend time on. We aren’t motivated by any tangible prize or even anything that we see to be worth it. We figure, most of us, that someone else will show us the way to love ourselves. And sometimes that’s true. Sometimes someone else points us in the right directions… reminds us that we’re worth a damn. True or not, however, truly loving ourselves makes us pure. We’re less likely to do all the things that we do to impress others… to keep up this image that we’ve “perfected”. That’s where it’s at, man. Giving a shit about ourselves. Looking in the mirror and smiling back knowing all the merits and flaws of the person looking back at you… loving that person and living accordingly.   But we don’t. Instead, most of us spend time enumerating and focusing on our weaknesses as if they somehow make us unworthy. We come to fear and hide our flaws from ourselves and others rather than embracing and dealing with them. Then we get all bitter and jaded and we lash out at the ones around us. It’s pathetic really. I heard (or read) a while ago that goes something like this:   A grandson told of his anger at a schoolmate who had done him an injustice. Grandfather said: 'Let me tell you a story.' 'I, too, have felt a great hate for those that have taken so much, with no sorrow for what they do. But, hate wears you down and does not hurt your enemy. It is like taking poison and wishing your enemy would die. I have struggled with these feelings many times. It is as if there are two wolves inside me: one is good and does no harm. He lives in harmony with all around him and does not take offense when no offense was intended. He will only fight when it is right to do so, and in the right way. But the other wolf is full of anger. The littlest thing will set him into a fit of temper. He fights with everyone, all the time, for no reason. He cannot think because his anger and hate are so great. It is hard to live with these two wolves inside me, for both of then try to dominate my spirit.' The boy looked intently into his grandfather's eyes and asked, 'Which one wins, Grandfather?' The grandfather solemnly replied, 'The one I feed.”   I’m not one for quick-serve morality tales but this one stuck with me.  'The one I feed.”  Damn. Speaks for itself.  Love is a hand job in the back of a Chevy. Love is a hard-on in the middle of gym class. Love is a cashier popping bubblegum behind the register in a pink halter top with shiny black fingernails and a stud in her tongue. Love is soul searching. Love is truth minus rationale and logic. Love is a beer glass that’s never empty.  Somehow I feel like I’ve digressed… imagine that….  Love :::grumble::: I wish there were an easier way about it all. No… not even that… I wish there were some sort of sense or order to it, you know? Something to be sure of… something that could be counted on other than the fact that the only guarantee is that if you aren’t careful, you will most certainly get burned.   Most of all, I realize that, with all my ranting, it’s what I want. And it’s what you bastards want too. :::shaking head::: it’s a vain wish… that I should be able to ignore it…. it being love - my want for love, to be more specific.  I’m tired of movies lying to me… telling me it’s easy if only I can be clever enough to plot my way into the heart of the one I love… or stupid enough to fall ass-backwards into love… or rich enough to buy them… or pathetic enough that they can’t help giving in to my whining pussy tears.  I’m tired of music telling me that love is the end all be all… that’s it’s all we’ll ever need… that love is so easy! All you have to do is :::insert dance craze::: ! I’m tired of music making something that was meant to be an  internal  epic, an  external  epic.    Clue #1:  No matter what a song tells you, your lover will not die for you… or bring you the moon or any of that shit… ever.   Clue #2:  Love is NOT all you need   Clue #3:  Love is like taking a massive shit… sometimes you can’t help it and sometimes you can and, though it can get tough and tricky at times, it’s worth it in the end.  Love is the end of fear.  Love is war is hell is on earth is beautiful.  Love is finally getting some sleep.  ...  --  Dexter Otis Green           ",5308,1000,Late Night Ramble on love truth beauty and understanding Well now after sleeping off my hangovers taking down

292,292,1510754,1,24,"           Damn, didn’t I used to write for this disturbing genital sore of a website? It’s been way too long…   Anyways, some quick updates, and then a little bit o’postin’ for the chillins.  First off, I’m sure you’ve heard the rumors about BEER AND PORN RADIO, and I’m here to tell you that they are TRUE. BEER AND PORN RADIO is in the works, and we’re hoping to bring the same depraved, offensive commentary to you in audio form sometime in the next few months. How will it work, you ask? The stream will be broadcast from the Internet on demand, meaning you’ll be able to listen to each episode at your own leisure, whenever you wish! Most importantly, the stream will be FREE! That’s right, no need to scour porn and warez sites looking for Beer n Porn MP3s – just follow the links from right here on the site and your virgin ears will be basted in the love juice we call social commentary. Check the site often for more details.  Second, we’ve recently added a new feature to BEER AND PORN. If you look above the posts you’ll see a link for the BEER AND PORN MESSAGE BOARDS. Here’s your chance to interact with others who waste their time reading Beer and Porn, along with the depraved souls who author the crap you read here every day! It’s free to sign up, and within minutes you’ll be trading sexually explicit jokes with the rest of us here at Beer and Porn! A word of caution – nothing on the board is censored, so if you have a weak soul or are prone to being offended, it’s best if you move on to something a little more tame, like the Disney online store or something. Otherwise, we’d love to have you!  Third, it’s time for a little shout out. We’re always excited to hear about Beer and Porn fans from around the globe. Your pal and mine, Mr. Dexter Otis Green, has done a fan-freakin-tastic job of tracking our readership across the globe. Recently, he identified the FIRST INSTANCE OF A PERSONAL WEBSITE LINKING TO BEER AND PORN! This is a monumental, historic moment in the annals of the Internet. Not only are people reading this tripe, but they are coming back, and they are TELLING THEIR FRIENDS! I am flush with pride and arrogance!  [DRUM ROLL, PLEASE]  Congratulations, AILIN from NOVA SCOTIA, CANADA! We’ve found your Beer and Porn link on your fantastic, award-winning webpage, and we’re here to say thanks! You are just the first step towards our eventual conquest of Canada, which we will use as the base for our global empire! You have earned yourself a high-ranking position in our eventual ruling government thanks to your obedience to the Beer and Porn movement! Har-har-har-ha! [Maniacal laughter and the twitching of fingers follows].  Seriously, Ailin, much appreciated. Drop us a line if you read this. Until then kiddies, visit her  urlLink website  and  urlLink weblog  and let her know how amazingly cool she is.   Moving on to the important stuff… Finally, the results of the last poll!    Who is -The Man?-   Whitey 130 (56%)   Jesus 6 (2%)   Whitey Pig Cops 8 (3%)   Ron Jeremy 17 (7%)   My mom, sadly. 69 (30%)   230 Total votes     Oh Jesus, you just couldn’t cut it this time, huh? Sadly, the Son of God himself couldn’t pull more than 2% of the overall vote. We tried to reach Mel Gibson for comment, but he was too busy counting the millions he made from preying on the devotion of the faithful to sell movie tickets to respond to our questions. Way to go Mel! If you’re such a good Christian, why don’t you donate all those profits from the “Passion” to charity? I’m sure that $200 million will help you buy a nice comfy Lay-Z-Boy at the right hand of Jesus when you’re finally called from this Earth, huh?  Does anyone honestly think it’s a coincidence that “Passion” was released around Ash Wednesday to coincide with the Easter season? That’s marketing, kids.   Coming in fourth was “Whitey Pig Cops,” which surprisingly only pulled 3% of the vote. I expected a little more voting love for the jerkoffs who continue to make the parking lots and side streets of the world safe with useless tickets while criminals are allowed to roam the streets raping, robbing and killing. Seriously. Ever see a bunch of cops eating lunch at a local restaurant, or grabbing coffee somewhere in the middle of the day? Ever want to just grab them by the throat and yell “Hey buddy, how about getting in your damn Pigmobile over there and SOLVING A FEW CRIMES WHILE YOU EAT THAT DANISH????” Ever want to slash the tires of a dumb-ass cop who’s pulled over someone for a minor traffic violation in the middle of rush-hour traffic, backing up cars for miles? Ever wonder why police only need a high school education to get a job? COPS ARE NOT YOUR FRIEND. THEY ARE NOT THERE TO PROTECT YOU. THEY ARE ONLY THERE TO PROTECT THE STATUS QUO.  Sorry, that wasn’t very funny. But I hate cops. Moving on.  In third place was my man, Ron Jeremy. Ron pulled 7% of the vote, beating Jesus by 11 votes, and again proving that Beer and Porn readers are the smartest readers of all. Ron Jeremy is the unsung hero of the American Porn Industry, which grosses more money per year than Hollywood. This is the honest truth. Pornography funnels millions of dollars in tax revenue into state and federal coffers every year, and silently allows media conglomerates to make profits. The porn industry is also responsible for many technological advances, such as the VCR, DVD, streaming video on the internet, encryption technology, and other high-tech methods of data transfer. Ron Jeremy, along with the other stars of the porn industry, we salute you! Not only did you get me through puberty, but you keep the American economy afloat! I’m going to celebrate with my Vivid DVDs…  In second place, we have your mom. I must say that I expected your mom to be the dark horse candidate, but she couldn’t put it all together in the end. I think we all know your mom’s qualifications in the area, and I think it’s safe to say that all of us here at Beer and Porn have an intimate relationship with your mom and her abilities. Your mom could be reached for comment, but we chose not to, because we aren’t interested in what she has to say, are we? We’re interested in what she can do…  Finally, the number one choice to the answer “Who is ‘The Man’?” – Whitey.  Speaking on behalf of Whitey, I’d like to make a brief acceptance speech.  I am probably the closest thing to the stereotypical Whitey that you can find. I’m white, for starters. Hopelessly white. Irish and Italian kind of white. Suburban Connecticut kind of white. Middle-middle class kind of white. Only child kind of white. The opposite of “diversity” kind of white. I put the “C” in Caucasian. I’m bland like Vanilla. I am the personification of Wonderbread. I fail to qualify for any scholarships. There are no outreach programs available to me. I am not protected by any equal opportunity mandates. I am not covered by any quotas. I am the reason for Affirmative Action. I have an albino soul. I am white.  I have been told from the day of my birth that I am bland and unoriginal. My ancestry is treated like potpourri trivia rather than a source of heritage or pride. My people, whoever they may be, are responsible for any and all social injustices you can find. I am responsible for slavery. I am responsible for patriarchy. I am responsible for the Jewish diaspora. I am responsible for the destruction of indigenous peoples in the Western Hemisphere. I am responsible for political lines in Africa and the Middle East that have destroyed tribes and caused civil unrest. I am the face of the Ku Klux Klan, of the Know-Nothing party, of National Socialism, of the Spanish Inquisition and untold other instruments of intolerance and cruelty. I am Big Tobacco. I am Big Government. I am Big Oil. I am Rich Uncle Pennybags, with a cigar in my mouth and a top hat on my head, running the world thanks to my white male privilege.  I am told that I run the show, and therefore I deserve no breaks. I am expected to prostrate repeatedly for the sins of my ancestors. I am afforded no breaks, no helping hands and no compassion. If I succeed, it is because of my white male privilege. If I fail, it is my fault and no one else’s. I am not allowed to enter into discourse about society, because my views are inherently racist, sexist, classist and bigoted. I am the personification of the sins of the world.   I am white. I am apparently “The Man.”   ---------------------  It’s difficult to talk about such things without exposing your shortcomings in reasoning due to your position in society. One could look at my social stature and claim that I am a perfect example of white privilege: well educated, self-sufficient, soon to receive my graduate degree and become a member of professional academia. You could say that I’ve never had to struggle to reach my goals, or fight preconceived notions of my abilities based on societal stereotypes. I certainly couldn’t argue with you – all I know is my own experience, and I can’t say whether my path has been eased by my skin color and gender. Some would say that is the case – and who am I to argue?  This I think is the point of my ridiculous rant above. It’s certainly fair to say that there are inherent social benefits to being male, or white, or both, in modern society. And it is just as important to expose these unfair advantages for what they are, as everyone should be afforded the same rights and opportunities in a truly free society. However, it often feels that as a member of white male America, I am immediately shut out of these discussions because of my perceived bigotry and/or involvement with the problems in society. Can a grown man speak about Feminism? Can a white man talk about racism? I’d like to think so – but in Politically Correct America, I’m afraid this may not be the case.  Anyways, on behalf of all Whiteys everywhere, I’d like to apologize. We’re trying our best to do the right thing. We’re just not all that good at it. Blame the fall of the Roman Empire. It messed us up pretty good, you know.  -Mr. Carson           ",5451,1000,Damn didn’t I used to write for this disturbing genital sore of a website It’s been way too long Anyways some quick updates

Guinness AML:   yes  Guinness AML:   because the word has come to be assigned to blacks  wongdongy:  so it means specifically black people   Guinness AML:   it sure does   …   It’s been over 15 years but I can still remember my first day of 3rd grade. I went to predominantly white schools from 3rd grade on up. Before then, growing up in Hartford, CT’s North End, I rarely ever saw white people other than teachers and a few folk when I went downtown with my mother. It goes without saying, then, that I had no white friends. In fact, I hated white people.    Hated.    Then, one evening, my mom came over to me and my younger brother and told us that we were going to a new school. Just like that, a new school. I didn’t have many friends in school, anyway, so leaving them wasn’t all that big a deal. My short lived (and utterly useless) protests came from the fact that it was a WHITE school. White people, white teachers, white nurses, white music, white everything… it honestly terrified me.  Let me explain.  I believed the following to be true about white people:  -- White people are rich…  all of them  -- White people are snotty and talk funny. -- White people eat weird food - white people food. (Swear to god) -- White people are smart – black people have to work twice as hard as white people. -- White people listen to disturbing music. Because of it, some white people worship the devil. -- White people can’t dance, sing, or play sports as well as black people.  and most importantly…  -- White people HATE black people. Period. Even if they claim to be your friend, they’re lying. They want something from you. Black friends are valuable – they’re evidence against racism – “I can’t be racist – look at my black (nigger) friend! See?!”   It’s also important to note that these things that I believed to be true about white people I never ever believed could be true about black people.   White people were pretty much evil and white people were certainly the enemy.    So, with all these prejudices, I went to my first day of 3rd grade shaking like a leaf. I thought that I’d come back acting like a white kid after a few days of school. I thought they’d try to jump me. I had to defend myself. I had to stay black at all costs. Walking down the hall to my classroom, I felt white eyes on me constantly and was very uncomfortable. Every pair of eyes said “Who is  that  (NIGGER!) kid? Why is he in my school? He doesn’t belong here”. I got to my first class and sat alone preparing for the inevitable introduction. Sure enough, I was brought to the front of the class and with my eyes on my cheap sneakers, I gave my name. Eyebrows curled and there were a few laughs because of my accent. I blushed hard and made note of their laughter – evidence. Then, it happened. “He’s from HARTFORD and he’ll be joining our class by way of Project Concern*”, my teacher chimed with a toothy white grin.   …   As far as I was concerned, she may as well have said, “Be careful – this one is a dangerous nigger – HE doesn’t belong here” I sat down feeling even more alienated than ever.   School was easy for the first half of the day. I was in class with no more than 5 kids at a time most of the time so that worked out fine. But I was still very uncomfortable being around all those white people. Then lunch came and I freaked. I had made zero friends that day which meant I either had to sit alone or sit with white people and try to make friends.    I sat alone.    I remember sitting with my left arm around my tray, eyeballing the cafeteria DARING anyone to sit near me. I was so lonely and, part of me really wanted someone to come over. But I wasn’t going to let them make me white. So I did the easiest thing a black kid could do in that school. I looked intimidating.   Months passed, seasons changed and I had made friends with the kids on my bus (also from Hartford) and a few kids in school. They treated me like a visitor but it was ok. I had a few friends and that was better than eating alone. I had a small group of friend to go on the swings with at recess. Life wasn’t all that bad.   ”Nigger!”   what?...    I looked up from a game of Speedball and my new friend… we’ll call him Dick Spiffy - was pointing at me.   He was pointing at  me ? Was I a nigger?       I knew I was black and that black people were sometimes called niggers by white people. But it was an entirely different thing to actually be called “Nigger” outright. I was, to say the least, a little confused. Then, it hit me. It hit me light a lightning bolt and I took off after him.   I beat the crap out of him.   In the principal’s office, I got nothing but sympathy. It didn’t go on my file or anything like that. It was dropped and I went back to class. But something had changed in me that took years to fix.   The question lingered. Nigger? ME!?! Am I a nigger? I didn’t know if it was true. Until then, I never had to ask myself if it was  true … and, if it was true… if I was a nigger… what did that mean?   Nigger was something they called slaves. It was worse than a bad word… it was a curse. When Dick resurrected that word, it felt worse than anything I had ever felt. I couldn’t say why then but I think I knew. Nigger meant “You are nothing – you are not one of us – You will never be one of us – You are less… low… and worthy of contempt”. It was the embodiment of the evils of slavery. In North America, from the 1500s to 1865, “Nigger” connoted “black slave” but also “Maroon (A fugitive Black slave in the West Indies in the 17th and 18th centuries).” From then on, “Nigger” connoted “second-class citizen” as well as “Maroon”… visitor… outcast. 23 years later it meant the very same thing when Dick used it on me… “Outcast! – Unclean!”   Not one of you reading this needs the history of the word to know what it means.   We all know what it means. There’s a definition beyond my words that we’re all familiar with. Nigger = hate. It’s all but impossible to know how fucked up of a word it is until that hate is directed at you.    Then there came Wigger.   Wow… Wigger? Are you fucking kidding me?  WIGGER?!    For the slow ones, “Wigger” is a clever combination of words – “White” and “Nigger”.  Astonishing.  Let me get this straight… a wigger is a “White Nigger”? What does that mean, exactly? Some kid wears Fubu and listens to 50-cent and Biggie and… well now he’s a Nigger… but he can’t be a  nigger  nigger because he’s white… so he’s a  white  nigger… a wigger… hahahaha! _ that’s clever… that’s funny!      Guinness AML:  You know why I hate wigger more than nigger?  Guinness AML:  Amercian blacks were given the word nigger and told 'This means you're nothing'  Guinness AML:  they took it and, over time, changed it to mean 'This means we're family' - it's an identifier... a sacred word  Guinness AML:  which is why I can call a black person a nigger and you can't  wongdongy:  wow  Guinness AML:  Wigger is thievery  wongdongy:  haha  Guinness AML:  we were given shit and made it an heirloom  Guinness AML:  and now it's being taken back?!  Guinness AML:  FUCK that   Yes – it is  our  word. Your grandfathers gave it to us, remember? They made sure we knew that it belonged to us and only us.   And it does.   Wigger isn’t an outright attempt at reclaiming the word but… well once black folk made nigger cool, wigger pops up….this fucking generic bullshit word that manages to be more insulting than the first. How? By downplaying the significance of the word “nigger”… Chinese dude “actin’ black” yo? He’s a chigga, B.   Nigger doesn’t mean black. Nigger IS black. It’s a black word. It’s a family curse that was converted to a blessing. A password. A conduit through which we can acknowledge the one thing that we all share – our victory over attempted dehumanization. We were once believed to be a dead people – less than animals. And, in many ways, we still live with the effects of the people who named us “nigger”. That’s why it’s our word… because it was given to us.  There a number of things I want to say on this subject but I’m gonna cut myself short this time… no wrap up, no summary… none of that. Hope this reaches reasonable ears….    --  Dexter Otis Green    *(note: Project Concern was a voluntary urban-to-suburban student transfer program. – basically taking kids from the inner-city shitty

296,296,1510754,1,24,"            A Treatise on Divine Intervention – 8/27/03   Much of this little corner of cyberspace has been dominated lately by discussions concerning the existence of a Divine Creator; whether He really exists, what is His plan for his creation, whether He is really a She, and all sorts of fun bits of trivia St. Augustine probably bored his dinner guests with. In the spirit of academic collaboration, I hereby throw my hat into the ring. And, since September is “Early Modern Western Theological Philosophy Month” in the state of South Dakota, I’ll begin by forming my argument from first principles.  To begin, a caveat.  I am an atheist.  This statement is going to affect my arguments concerning the topic at hand. First and foremost is my lack of faith in the presence of a God/many Gods/all-encompassing Spirit/etc. I do not disdain faith, however. This is a common misconception among the God-fearing population at large concerning the atheist. I feel faith is one of the most essential human qualities, and allows people to strive for greatness when their path is unclear. As the apostles had faith in Jesus the Savior, so did Galileo have faith in a sun-centered solar system, as did Newton have faith in gravity and Pasteur have faith in the germ theory of spontaneous generation (translation: bugs make ya sick). The common thread of all faith is a trust in the existence of that which cannot be proven. Some have faith in God, I have faith in the evolution of life from a puddle of goo. Try to prove either.  Now I ask the religious in the audience to stick around until the end. Yes, I am an atheist, but I’m not here to argue against the existence of God. My esteemed colleague Dexter Otis Green already did quite a number on the Almighty a couple of weeks previously and it would be foolish of me to try to follow in his footsteps. Instead, I’m going to start from the same basis as our esteemed European thinkers did three or four hundred years ago.   Let’s assume, just for fun, that there is a God.   A number of postulates follow from this assumption. First, if there is a God, He (sorry girls, but it’s easier to keep with tradition than writing She or He/She or S/He or It or The Great Hermaphroditic Force in the Sky – my apologies) must play some sort of role in existence as we know it. Regardless of whether He is a part of reality, or outside reality, or however you want to conceive of Him, His handprint must be a part of our perceived universe simply because He exists, is all-powerful and played some sort of role in the creation of all this muckety-muck.   Secondly, if He does exist, and does play a role in existence, then we can assume that He can directly affect the goings-on in reality. This follows from the assumption that God is all-powerful. We can elevate this statement as a postulate simply because if God wasn’t all-powerful, he wouldn’t be God and therefore would be a great big cipher in existence. Therefore, all sorts of biblical craziness becomes plausible, from creation to the words of the prophets to burning bushes to plagues to the commandments.  This isn’t to say it happened exactly to the letter of the Good Book, but it allows for such things to occur.  So, let’s recap our first principles, a la Descartes:  1)There is a God 2)He is all-powerful 3)He must play a role in existence, either through existing within it’s boundaries or by affecting things within the boundaries of existence 4)THEREFORE: God must be able to interact with existence 5)THEREFORE: God must be able to interact with us  Simple enough, right? Conclusion #5 follows from our connection with reality. Now, however, comes the tricky part. If God can interact with us, and God does interact with us, then God must have a motive for interacting with us. This leads to another interesting conclusion:  1)God must be able to interact with us 2)God can affect changes in existence through his interactions with us 3)THEREFORE: God must have a motivation for his interactions with us 4)THEREFORE: God must desire to make changes in existence  This is extremely important. For God to interfere in the daily activities of mere mortals, he must have a motivation to act. If he has a motivation, he has a desire. And if God has desires, then God must have actions that support his desires and that detract from his desires. Such is the basis for sin – actions by mortals that act in counter to the desires of God.   AHA! But how could mere mortals hope to understand the mind of the infinite? How can we determine what is and what is not part of God’s plan? It’s not possible - unless God himself gives us a clue about what and what not to do. And as we stated before, God is perfectly capable of interacting with us when and how He pleases. And now we reach a critical juncture in our understanding of the Big Cheese:  1)God has desires for His creation 2)Creation cannot deduce the mind of God (because the finite mind cannot comprehend the infinite) 3)THEREFORE: For creation to understand the desires of God, He must allow his desires to be known 4)THEREFORE: God must expose his desires to Creation through His interactions with it.  Now we’re able to bring in the Bible, the Koran, the Torah and Talmud, the words of the prophets, the burning bushes, the dead sea scrolls and anything else documenting the interactions of God with his creation. One can still argue that the true desires of God can be diluted or distorted by those who document His works, but this does not affect the original motivation or the actual occurrence. God works in mysterious ways, which means humanity more often than not will probably miss the point, but that doesn’t stop God from trying.  Now that we’ve defined our God, we should be able to conceive of how we choose to interact with Him. And here, finally, is my theory concerning God.  If there is a God, we should spend less time worshipping him and more time preparing for him.  It’s clear from the classic works of western monotheism that God takes care of His people. When he chose Abraham and Sarah as the first of his great people, he gave to them the land of Israel, and watched over their development as the first great civilization to know God. When they strayed from his teachings, he allowed the Godless Egyptians to enslave them and destroy the great temple at Jerusalem. However, He did not condemn His people; when they had learned their lesson, he sent a great prophet to lead them out of bondage and back to their promised land. He sent them a code of laws to live by so that they may live according to His will. These great laws were written in stone and placed in the Ark of the Covenant, which the descendants of the slaves used to conquer the Godless tribes that inhabited the Promised Land in the Israelites’ absence. The Old Testament tells of Joshua marching the Ark around the fortified city of Jericho, causing the walls to collapse out of the sheer power of God’s will. When again the Israelites lost their way, he sent His only son to live among the people, to learn of the plight of mortality and to share the glory of the Kingdom of Heaven with God’s creation. He then allowed all of civilization to know of his glory, through the works of the apostles and the teachings of the great prophet Mohammad. God, it can be said, takes care of his peeps.  But look at the world that we live in today. Our great God-fearing country is beset on all sides by the tyranny of evil men, to borrow a phrase. People working in the Almighty’s name murdered thousands of Americans in the attacks on the Twin Towers. The great Christian countries of the Western world are under attack by the Eastern Islamic peoples who see Westernization as the mark of the Great Satan. The holy land itself is a war zone, where children are torn apart by suicide bombers in the shadow of the once great and holy Temple in Jerusalem. The great countries of Pakistan and India are close to a nuclear holocaust, spurred by land disputes but fueled by differences in religion. Belfast has been in tatters for centuries because of differences in Christian denominations, not even divides in religions. Much of the conflict in the world today is either directly caused or indirectly motivated by differences in religions that have at their core a faith in God.  So how do we view God’s divine plan in the light of recent events? Are we, the Great Western World, the harbingers of peace and justice? Is God on our side as we force our own brand of peace through free trade on the proud peoples of the Middle East? Or are we actually playing the role of the Egyptians, enslaving God’s people with our sinful ways and our Western ideals which are counter to His will? What gives us the preconception that God might actually be on our side? Don’t forget our previous postulate: we cannot know the mind of God, for the finite mind cannot understand the infinite.  So who knows where we stand? What we do know is that, for whatever reason, God feels no desire to step in at the present time and heal the pain and sorrow of millions. He felt no desire to stop the suicide bombings in Gaza; no desire to stop the state-sponsored killings in many an Islamic fundamentalist state; no desire to divert the planes from their intended targets two Septembers ago. So we must ask ourselves: what is God trying to tell His creation with his inaction?  Perhaps it is time to stop acting in God’s name, and time to start preparing for the coming of God’s wrath. For I guarantee that many a faithful person died in the Trade Center attacks, and I wonder why God failed to save their lives that day - much as God fails to save the lives of those killed by U.S. bombs worldwide.  Who dares to understand the mind of such a vengeful God?  -Mr. Carson           ",5530,1000,A Treatise on Divine Intervention Much of this little corner of cyberspace has been dominated lately by discussions concerning the existence of a Divine Creator whether He really exists what is His plan for his creation whether He is really a She and all sorts of fun bits of trivia St Augustine probably bored his dinner guests with In the spirit of academic collaboration I hereby throw my hat into the ring And since September is Early Modern Western Theological Philosophy Month in the state of South Dakota I’ll begin by forming my argument from first principles To begin a caveat I am an atheist This statement is going to affect my arguments concerning the topic at hand First and foremost is my lack of faith in the presence of a God/many Gods/all-encompassing Spirit/etc I do not disdain faith however This is a common misconception among the God-fearing population at large concerning the atheist I feel faith is one of the most essential human qualities and allows people to strive for greatness when their path is unclear As the apostles had faith in Jesus the Savior so did Galileo have faith in a sun-centered solar system as did Newton have faith in gravity and Pasteur have faith in the germ theory of spontaneous generation translation bugs make ya sick The common thread of all faith is a trust in the existence of that which cannot be proven Some have faith in God I have faith in the evolution of life from a puddle of goo Try to prove either Now I ask the religious in the audience to stick around until the end Yes I am an atheist but I’m not here to argue against the existence of God My esteemed colleague Dexter Otis Green already did quite a number on the Almighty a couple of weeks previously and it would be foolish of me to try to follow in his footsteps Instead I’m going to start from the same basis as our esteemed European thinkers did three or four hundred years ago Let’s assume just for fun that there is a God A number of postulates follow from this assumption First if there is a God He sorry girls but it’s easier to keep with tradition than writing She or He/She or S/He or It or The Great Hermaphroditic Force in the Sky my apologies must play some sort of role in existence as we know it Regardless of whether He is a part of reality or outside reality or however you want to conceive of Him His handprint must be a part of our perceived universe simply because He exists is all-powerful and played some sort of role in the creation of all this muckety-muck Secondly if He does exist and does play a role in existence then we can assume that He can directly affect the goings-on in reality This follows from the assumption that God is all-powerful We can elevate this statement as a postulate simply because if God wasn’t all-powerful he wouldn’t be God and therefore would be a great big cipher in existence Therefore all sorts of biblical craziness becomes plausible from creation to the words of the prophets to burning bushes to plagues to the commandments This isn’t to say it happened exactly to the letter of the Good Book but it allows for such things to occur So let’s recap our first principles a la Descartes There is a God He is all-powerful He must play a role in existence either through existing within it’s boundaries or by affecting things within the boundaries of existence THEREFORE God must be able to interact with existence THEREFORE God must be able to interact with us Simple enough right Conclusion follows from our connection with reality Now however comes the tricky part If God can interact with us and God does interact with us then God must have a motive for interacting with us This leads to another interesting conclusion God must be able to interact with us God can affect changes in existence through his interactions with us THEREFORE God must have a motivation for his interactions with us THEREFORE God must desire to make changes in existence This is extremely important For God to interfere in the daily activities of mere mortals he must have a motivation to act If he has a motivation he has a desire And if God has desires then God must have actions that support his desires and that detract from his desires Such is the basis for sin actions by mortals that act in counter to the desires of God AHA But how could mere mortals hope to understand the mind of the infinite How can we determine what is and what is not part of God’s plan It’s not possible unless God himself gives us a clue about what and what not to do And as we stated before God is perfectly capable of interacting with us when and how He pleases And now we reach a critical juncture in our understanding of the Big Cheese God has desires for His creation Creation cannot deduce the mind of God because the finite mind cannot comprehend the infinite THEREFORE For creation to understand the desires of God He must allow his desires to be known THEREFORE God must expose his desires to Creation through His interactions with it Now we’re able to bring in the Bible the Koran the Torah and Talmud the words of the prophets the burning bushes the dead sea scrolls and anything else documenting the interactions of God with his creation One can still argue that the true desires of God can be diluted or distorted by those who document His works but this does not affect the original motivation or the actual occurrence God works in mysterious ways which means humanity more often than not will probably miss the point but that doesn’t stop God from trying Now that we’ve defined our,81,test
299,299,1510754,1,24,"            Kozak crosses over    December 8, 2003   Well that’s it, kids. I’m writing this two days after Kozak’s brush with death and, I gotta say. the kid did good. We put him through hell and he came out smiling on the other side… granted we had to carry the bastard to the other side but I think you get the picture. You’d’ve had to have been there to understand the extent of the magic that took place. However, I was a wise booze-hound and keep a diary on Kozak’s exploits. Granted, I was drinking at the time… the entire day and well into the next, in fact, so I can’t guarantee that this is 100% accurate. Look to Kozak and the other fellas for confirmation. Meanwhile, just take my word for it and… well follow the wobbling Kozak.   December 6, 2003    10:02 AM ... Jake wakes up   We throw open his door, jam a Santa hat down on his head, and hand him a beer. He doesn’t ask any questions which is probably the wisest decision of the day. He drinks his beer. We smile. It’s begun.    12:52 PM ... Jakes falls down   The cock-rocking duo Two Kings is in attendance and they perform “Untouchable Wang (the loneliest virgin)”. Kozak is tickled pink. Then the booze gets in him and things take a turn. Kozak, after [winning?/losing] a beer pong tournament and throwing back eleventy-million shots, falls on the couch banging the back of his head pretty hard against the edge of the counter. He goes fetal for about 2 min and then quickly gets back to drinking after he’s able to uncurl. I smile inside knowing what’s to come. Kozak starts to show signs that he’s no longer good to drive.    1:00 PM ... Jake has become a raving lunatic   At this point, Jake has begun declaring a number of things… none of which make any sene whatsoever. We generally ignore him and keep drinking. Jake follows suit with the drinking but continues to rant. I think he humped my leg at some point around this hour but I’m not exactly sure. I’m doing my best not to shove shots and booze down Kozak’s throat. The kid is doing a fine job of that without any help from me.    1:05 PM ... Jake falls off of a stationary couch   Sweet Jesus… and it’s more like he falls into a pile on the side of the couch laughing drunkenly to himself. I’ve never seen Jake this wasted and its… well… goddamn awesome. He’s smiling to himself on the floor, drool glistening at the corners of his mouth, eyes half closed, his body rocking gently with subtle drunken laughter. I’m pretty sure that he has no idea where he is or who we are. I know that he’s on the floor because he truly cannot stand. What’s more, I know that as soon as he has the strength, he’ll be up… and drinking. I’m immediately jealous and double my drinking rate. Take THAT Kozak.    1:08 PM ... Jake declares that his own mom his 'Hot'...(what the fuck?)   This we really don’t understand. To be honest, Jake’s mom is attractive. But what the hell possessed the kid to come out with this madness? None of us know or care at that point. It’s almost like a car accident. Kozak has become a booze monster and we’re feeding the demon so’s that we can all be safe. At this point Kozak has ceased to make sense 90% of the time. Those of us who know better are proud of him.    1:09 PM ... Apparently Jake is unable to lay on the couch without holding on...(wow)   This pretty much explains itself. Kozak has become a series of heaps appearing and disappearing all over the apartment. We’re trying to think of a way to slow him down and we’re all drawing a blank. He begins pouring his own shots. We watch in semi-drunken horror and fascination. Kozak wields the vodka like some vile liquid sword. We give him plenty of space. Occasionally he talks but, at this point, it’s all garbled nonsense.    1:11 PM ... Kozak parents arrive with food unbeknownst to Kozak.... Jake shits his pants... then proceeds to hug everyone... over and over... and over... and over... ... and  over... (wow)   This was one of my favorite moments in the day. Earlier that week, we thought it would be awesome to have Jake’s parents over to see there son all wrecked and such. I called over to his house and asked his mom if they’d come over. She responded with an enthusiastic, “Sure! What do you want us to bring?”. This day, they walk in to find Jake in pile form. He’s managed to find a way to stay on the couch. I guess that’s good. He hears his mom’s voice and cringes/smiles. His parents come in to view the drunken wonder that is their son and the kid does not disappoint. He doesn’t really speak a version  of English that most mortals understand at this point. He’s been reduced to gesturing and hugging to show his affection and he does it with great fervor. The parents smile and sit back and watch. We bring them into the foreground by teaching them beer pong. Jake has disappeared.    1:54 PM ... Jake spews   Just as the Kozak parents were leaving, we find the kid. He’s vomiting… hardcore. We all cringe a bit, knowing that this is probably the end of the party. We take turns going in to check on and comfort the kid. He seems to have and endless supply of spew. We pray for his salvation.    2:08 PM ... Jake is still puking   Jen R. goes in to take pictures and Jake says 'I can tell it's you by your laugh.... I hate you you stupid bitch!' Jen proceeds to take the picture like a tropper. I laugh my goddamn cock off. After picking up my cock, I use this opportunity to catch up on some drinking. Kozak continues to spew. I smile proudly at our work.     2:14 PM  Dry Heaves...   OK… this isn’t fun anymore. Granted, I’m not the one puking so I have very little to say on the matter. We continue to drink and continue to help him. I just want him to feel better so’s we can get more booze in him. Ironic, I know…    2:58 PM  puking... then passing out… thank Jesus   It’s all brown fun coming out of his mouth at this point. English is a second language. The kid isn’t all smiles and, after he stops heaving and chucking, we carry him into his room and he wraps himself in blankets and curls up like an oversized baby Jesus. Honestly, I hope he wakes up soon so that he can keep drinking with us. Mostly I hope he’s ok… I’m not a total ass clown….    8:00 PM  STILL passed out   What the hell? He’s still passed out and I’m trashed by now… feeling somewhat guilty that I’m at his party drinking beer and such that’s intended for him whilst he’s unconscious. Also feeling a bit cheated. I honestly didn’t think the kid would have passed out by the time he did but, then again, I had no idea that he was capable of drinking so goddamn much.    8:31 PM  Kozak finally awakes proclaiming 'There are levels of survival which I am willing to accept!'   Rock duo  Two Kings  goes in to check on Kozak and he flips out proclaiming the above. Kozak gets out of bed and …well… things take a turn. Kozak wakes up with a “fuck that shit” attitude and starts drinking. A tear comes to my eye.     8:40 PM  Kozak continues drinking... He is then dubbed, the 'Booze Phoenix'   Shortly thereafter, Keystone is dubbed his official drink (by whom I do not know) and he is subsequently named “Keystone Phoenix”. Kozak seems to care less about his title and more about his booze. He puts it away like a champ and we stay the hell out of his way.     9:18 PM  Kozak is doing shots... game on   Sweet Christ of life… what the hell is he doing? - Is that Jagermeister? 151?... Dobbs gets the idea to make Skittlebrau... My god… Kozak consumes. We pray.    10:10 PM  Power hour   Santenella has invited us all to a power hour. Kozak joins us. My chest swells with pride. We drink and drink. The power hour CD is, thankfully, all Christmas songs. The apartment has become a drunken chorus. I’ve rarely ever seen anything that happy. I look up and Kozak is gone…  . I keep drinking and finish off the power hour.     ??? PM  ???    After drinking all day, I’ve lost track of damn near everyone. Passing out on the couch, I’m hoping Kozak is ok. He was smiling last I saw so I’m good. I hope he enjoyed his birthday. I pass out.       So… here’s a side of Kozak you’ve likely never seen. I certainly haven’t. This kid became an unstoppable train. Hell… we didn’t go anywhere NEAR the strip club. Kozak, if you’re reading this, I love you, kid. To the rest of you kids, I hope this puts things into  perspective. Instant Message Kozak at Artic Cataclysm. Tell him things. Meanwhile, I’m headed off. During the writing of this article, I’ve put away 6 beers. Figured it was appropriate to be drinking.

306,306,1510754,1,24,"            Alright... this is getting a little ridiculous. Yet another kid has coerced me into posting his one-handed jibberings. What the fuck? Not to mention the fact that this lil' bitch still didn't sign the guestbook... (hint hint)  :::shaking head:::  Alright fine...

Here it is...  ...and sign the guestbook for crissakes....  --Dexter   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   (Insert responsible title here)   Well, I figured it’s time to throw my hat into the intellectual foray that is this blog.  Like a phoenix rising from the ashes, so did I the day of and after my birthday.  (In case you can’t figure it out yet, I’m the person Dexter’s December 8 article is about)  I figured it would be appropriate to discuss something that’s been irritating the hell out of me with people lately.  What I am referring to, of course, is personal responsibility. Now, why is it that I have decided to bitch about this? Was it Dexter’s talk about the yummy scrumptious babies that happen when people finish coitus? Was it the old rant on God is and does He or She exist?  Well, it’s a combination of the two, complete with my own beer-battered, deep-fried, baked and blended two cents to add to the mix.  Now, I realize I haven’t said anything about it right now, and I would say that I am to blame for that. I’m the one writing it, so it’s my fault.  There, personal responsibility.  People nowadays are completely unwilling to own up to their own actions.  In the Corporate world, look no further than Enron, the entire board denies any wrongdoing even when the evidence is thrown right in their faces.  In more recent news, take a look at Martha Stewart. That bitch damn well knew she was engaging in insider trading and still she denies that she did anything wrong.  HELLO, someone high in a company tells you something that will make or break a company, and you do something with your holdings, suck it up Martha, I hope your fellow inmates will show you the true meaning of a “Christmas Bouquet.”  Because of the fact that everyone sees these huge corporations dodging social responsibility, they assume that they can lie, cheat, and steal.  Let’s look at what goes on deep in the realm of Springerdom, where Ricki, and Montel, and Jerry are the lords and ladies of some perverted oligarchy where the rampant unprotected sex produces more kids than Michael Jackson could ever hope to molest. Now I’m not saying that the unprotected sex is the problem, like I said, I’m talking about personal responsibility.  It doesn’t pain me to see that children are being born in this world “by accident,” whether the condom broke, she missed a pill, or the phone rang and startled you when you were going to pull out. What bothers me about the whole thing is that the guys sometimes deny that the kid is theirs (because, let’s face it folks, the women are da hoes, right?) or that even if they acknowledge that it is their child, they refuse to take care of him for whatever reason.  That’s the bitch.  Seriously, how the hell can you call yourself any form of human when you damn well know that you caused a life to come into the world, and then choose not to take care of it?  I thought exposing was a relic from Ancient Greece.  We’re no longer physically exposing our unwanted kids to the elements, killing the undesired off, the ones we do allow into the world are being exposed socially and emotionally.  I don’t think I could have made it 21 years without both of my parents. Does that make me weak? Maybe.  However, with all seriousness, take care of your fucking kids. There’s nothing more irresponsible than not taking care of one of your own that you caused.  Parents, don’t think you aren’t falling under the knife tonight.  Parents are letting their kids get out of control.  They are YOUR children. Now I’m not advocating abusing kids, but I know that through discipline I learned how to take care of myself in the world. (I can just hear the bleeding hearts now about how I got spanked as a kid.  Get over it. I deserved every one.)  And some advice to parents:  The television is not a babysitter!  Don’t just plop little Timmy down in front of the boob tube while you go out. The flashing images on the TV is no replacement for taking little Johnny to the store with YOU, even if he is a whiny little bastard and an embarrassment to you when you can’t control him after YOU have pumped enough sugar in him that he could cause avalanches with the sound of his screams.  Simply put, YOU are responsible for your kids, because they don’t know any better, and nor will they know any better unless YOU show them the way.  Let’s go back to me for a second, ‘cause I’m not immune to this either.  A couple of Saturdays ago my friends got me absolutely stumbling drunk and all that to celebrate my 21st birthday.  Now, let’s say for a minute that something happened that day and I ended up in the hospital, or worse, dead.  Now, I in the hospital on life support from breaking ribs from vomiting so hard and having the shards cut through my stomach would undoubtedly suck ass, so I’m glad I avoided such an extreme fate.  All I had to show for it was being carried to my bed by my friends, and them wondering if I’d be ok.  (See the Dec. 8 article for the details)  The point is that they didn’t tell me to do anything I wasn’t already in the mindset to do. Hence, if I were to have gotten hurt, there’s no one to blame except for me.  They (meaning my friends) put me in that environment, but I was definitely the one who ultimately decided to go with it.  Ergo, even if I did blame them for my getting hurt (which I wasn’t) the blame still lies with me, because I did it of my own free will. I don’t buy this whole “I was drunk so whatever I did shouldn’t count” shit.  If you were stupid enough to drink so much that you did something really stupid, then you need to own up to it. In fact, any of the things that I did that I felt bad about on my birthday the appropriate people and authorities have been apologized to.  What am I getting at?  Does this kid ever shut up?  Yes, very soon.   This whole diatribe is about one thing: Owning up to your own actions.  Don’t start blaming others when things go to shit.  Not every bad thing that happens to someone is a conspiracy by the Martian Council to fuck up John Q Public’s life.  I’m not saying we all should be angels, but if you fucked up, and you’re called on it, then stop the bullshit and own up to it, and face the consequences.  And if you’ve just read this whole thing and are disgusted by it, you have no one to blame but yourself.  ‘Til I rise from the ashes again…  --Jake 'The Phoenix' Kozak         ",5351,1000,Alright this

I could go on forever but I doubt that I’d ever be able to make my case so here it is in a nutshell. Turn of the idiot box and try a book (you know, those funny looking things that you’re always banning and burning)… take a stand, it’s ok. People are supposed to disagree… it’s what makes the world go ‘round. and finally, don’t shun the masses of brainwashed self-deluded hippie hopefuls who have anestitised themselves (and likely others) to the harsh yet satisfying reality that we aren’t all different or all the same.

317,317,1510754,1,24,"                 So here I sit at 7:05 AM on a Sunday morning swadled in quilts and goose-flesh. I'm trying to get my head back on straight. I'm trying to figure out what the hell happened in the past few days...  Wednesday  I left for Cape Cod after a fairly uneventful day. The plan was that I take the train into Braintree [try saying that 3 times fast... (take the train into Braintree) it's not all that hard but it's got a catchy rhythm] and Sasquatch and Tom would pick me up on Union St. There was a Sox game (which we won) that night and traffic in the city would be hell. I contested that traffic on the T would be hell as well but, whatever, I knew where to go. I hopped on the Orange Line, hot-footed to the Red Line and sat down on a train with 'Braintree' glowing on it's forehead.  [cue unplanned calamity]  While I was on the train, the switches that allow trains to move from one track to another malfunctioned. The train had to be temporarily shutdown... with ALL that friggin' Sox traffic.  wow...  MBTA's alternative was to put us all (that's right - ALL) on a few busses and ferry us over to Quincy Center/Braintree that way. We unloaded the T at Quincy [pronounced 'Quinzy'] and piled onto the buses. We were clearly making the most of the space the busses afforded. I was stuck standing next to the driver and God help me if I wasn't using all of my strength not to let the throngs of people send me carrening over the danger-indicating 'yellow line' and out the windshield.  What a rush.  We finally arrived in Braintree and I was set free from the masses. We had been let off at the bus terminal [and not the train terminal, of course]. My ride didn't know all of this and so it was still up to me to find Union Street. Not a problem. I found a sign with an arrow pointing to Union Street after a brief jaunt/looksee and headed down the road toward what I thought would be the otherside of the station - 'Where the exit for the trains must be', I thought.  The Dentist’s office made a fool out of me.  That's about how far I got before I started thinking that if I went a little farther, I may never find my way back. Winded but undaunted, I headed back from whence I came. Lo and behold! My ride came growling up the road to meet me.   Rapture.  We were at the Cape in 45 min.   Wednesday @ midnight - Turtles  I can't/won't say much about turtles. I will say that I had ten (10) candidates who were stuck on economics (L8). Very shortly after we began, the scene went foul. Everyone was puking - everyone had their own personal garbage bag that they were faithfully filling with vomit (some went through more than one bag). It smelled worse than a burning leper colony. And the game hadn't been going on for more than and hour. It was a nightmare.  Such is Turtles I guess [shrug].  I was honestly more interested in handing down the Turtles Master title than I was in finishing the game. Austin (Master hopeful) was in a bad way that night and putting him through would not do. So be it. The game ended with 7 out of 10 victorious. I don't rememeber where I finally ended up sleeping.   Thursday - Cape day 2  I awoke and was immediatly aware of a motherbitch hangover. One of the youngins recognized my condition and handed me a bottle of J.W. Red. It did the trick. Bless you, Tom. I learned that shotgunning beer and stumbling about makes the day go by much faster. Fortunatly no one was hurt and, in fact, I got some tasty cake out of the deal. To be honest, though, I could only tell you that it may have been chocolate. I can't confirm that.  I decided that I didn't want to leave as Turtle Master and took Austin away.  We came back.  There's a new Turtle Master. Awesome.  Later that night I was punched in the face. Which was fine because previous to this, the offender had shieled my naked body from crowds of beweildered co-eds as I crossed the hostile territory toward ice and more confusion. Hand to God. Thanks Phil and Tom.  I still am not entirely sure why I was naked.  Apparently I joined a fraternity.  I wasn't even supposed to be there that night.  Sasquatch had arranged a ride so that I could stay an extra night and then proceeded to leave with all my crap in his car.  I haven't shaved in about a week now.  I collapsed in a heap on someone's couchbed mumbling to myself and apparently drooling. I woke up hurting and was brought home in the relative comfort of Austin's car. I hopped the train back home and gladly climbed the 5 flights of stairs to my apt.  I'm gonna have an incredible ass come the end of this summer.  I wasn’t at my apartment long. All roads eventually lead to Forest Hills and, you guessed it, an hour later I was on the T to Sean’s place. I had almost forgotten that I had a gig early the next morning.  Meet the newest member of The Boston City Band.  ...oh and the Worchester [pronounced Wuh-stuh] Brass Band.  Who would have thought that I could get so much done in a day.  I met up with my fellow bandmates in a small Christian town outside of Boston. After a short parade (and a rather terrifying Orwellian Speech at the town square) we headed over to the American Legion for some free grub.  Money.  Then it was back to Boston and Star Market [read: Shaw’s].  I have food - thank God.  The rest of the day wasn't too exciting. Sean lent me his iMac for the summer seeing as how my computers (that’s right - plural) have given out on me.  [cue Dobber chanting 'One of us! One of us!']  I found out that there’s a sweet little mama of a brick oven pizza place not 100 yards from my stoop... and they have Guinness AND PBR on tap.  Nice.  I climbed the stairs for what must have been the 5th time that day and eventually collapsed into a semi-naked heap on my little twin bed.  So I guess I do have a fair idea of what went down the last few days.   In a few hours, I go to march in some other small Christ-driven town. Right now, though, I’m gonna have a smoke, a shower, and, God willing,  a breakfast sandwich from BK.  BK - oh how I love thee.

324,324,1604072,1,47,"           011704132726...Rochester NY---  Let's start out with basic fact: The Democrats are electoral trouble... serious electoral trouble. The polling data over the last six months and longer clearly and consistently places President Bush several dozen percentage points over any rival the Democrats can come up with, including Hillary Clinton.  So you can imagine their glee when Paul O'Neill stepped into the spotlight, having been pushed by Ron Suskind. The book Suskind wrote “The Price of Loyalty: George W. Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O'Neill.” must have seemed the right tool at the right time. The press, dealing with small news cycles in Iraq, and the ungodly boring events in Iowa... which everyone suspects will in the end be meaningless, was looking for some spark, and hoping they could fan it into a flame to burn down the Presidency of one George W. Bush. O'Neill looked to be the match to star this fire.  It amazes me... the short memory that the left has. It was just two short years ago that he was the brunt of jokes from the left. Now suddenly they take him seriously. Why? Because he's giving them something to chew on other than their own recent failings.  Immediately,  and predictably, the leftist hacks started working on out of context and twisted quotes from Mr. O'Neill.  Said one such hack:      'Like a blind man in a roomful of deaf people.' That certainly captured my attention: DUH-Be-Ya's own ex-secretary of the Treasury describing Baby Bush's clueless demeanor at a Cabinet meeting.'  But was it really so?  No, this is leftist dominated news media twists, because what O'Neill really said was that HE felt like 'Like a blind man in a roomful of deaf people.', not that Mr. Bush was acting that way.   He was complaining, in short, that he felt disconnected from the processes of the White House.   Let's look at the bigger lines the Democrats and the press (A redundancy) seized upon:  *  O'Neill had seen no evidence of WMD in Iraq, and from day one the Bush Administration was hell-bent on deposing Saddam.  Well, it didn't take too much thinking to notice a little problem... O'Neill is complaining he's out of the loop and yet we're supposed to take his seeing no evidence of WMD to mean that WMD do not exist in Iraq?  * The Bush administration from Day one, wanted Saddam out of power and was willing to do what it needed to do to make that happen.  Ted Kennedy made a speech the other day, trying to sell the same dishwater: That Mr. Bush had made the whole thing up the act was illegal, and so on. The Democrats are focused like a laser on this point because they know it to be their only hope to regain power.  Well, perhaps Democrats have shorter memories than the rest of us, or perhaps they're just not wanting to tell us the truth.  But I seem to recall something called the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998, which was passed by the house with a large majority, and unanimously by the Senate. Meaning Kennedy voted for regime change in Iraq, in 1998. He may have been drunk at the time, and may not remember it, but he voted for it. The act as passed and signed into law by President Clinton declares that it should be the policy of the United States to seek to remove the Saddam Hussein regime from power in Iraq and to replace it with a democratic government.  So, it appears Mr. Bush was obeying the law. If we're to believe with the Democrats, that all this is Mr. Bush's doing, we also then think, as the Colorado Conservative notes in his blog, that      '....Bush is SOOOOO Evil that he was able to enact regime change in Iraq TWO YEARS BEFORE HE WAS ELECTED. FOUR YEARS BEFORE THE ACTUAL WAR'  I should also point up that one complaint from the left was that Bush went into Iraq with no plan. Now he's tried  and convicted in the press of doing what the Democrats wanted...following a pre-set, well thought out plan... in fact he was planning it all along. Which way are they going with this?  But let's look closer at this claim of President Bush making it all up, let's look at what the Congress had to say on the point, also by way of Colorado's site:       The Congress makes the following findings:     (1) On September 22, 1980, Iraq invaded Iran, starting an 8 year war in which Iraq employed chemical weapons against Iranian troops and ballistic missiles against Iranian cities.      (2) In February 1988, Iraq forcibly relocated Kurdish civilians from their home villages in the Anfal campaign, killing an estimated 50,000 to 180,000 Kurds.      (3) On March 16, 1988, Iraq used chemical weapons against Iraqi Kurdish civilian opponents in the town of Halabja, killing an estimated 5,000 Kurds and causing numerous birth defects that affect the town today.      (4) On August 2, 1990, Iraq invaded and began a 7 month occupation of Kuwait, killing and committing numerous abuses against Kuwaiti civilians, and setting Kuwait's oil wells ablaze upon retreat.      (5) Hostilities in Operation Desert Storm ended on February 28, 1991, and Iraq subsequently accepted the ceasefire conditions specified in United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 (April 3, 1991) requiring Iraq, among other things, to disclose fully and permit the dismantlement of its weapons of mass destruction programs and submit to long-term monitoring and verification of such dismantlement.      (6) In April 1993, Iraq orchestrated a failed plot to assassinate former President George Bush during his April 14-16, 1993, visit to Kuwait.      (7) In October 1994, Iraq moved 80,000 troops to areas near the border with Kuwait, posing an imminent threat of a renewed invasion of or attack against Kuwait.      (8) On August 31, 1996, Iraq suppressed many of its opponents by helping one Kurdish faction capture Irbil, the seat of the Kurdish regional government.      (9) Since March 1996, Iraq has systematically sought to deny weapons inspectors from the United Nations Special Commission on Iraq (UNSCOM) access to key facilities and documents, has on several occasions endangered the safe operation of UNSCOM helicopters transporting UNSCOM personnel in Iraq, and has persisted in a pattern of deception and concealment regarding the history of its weapons of mass destruction programs.      (10) On August 5, 1998, Iraq ceased all cooperation with UNSCOM, and subsequently threatened to end long-term monitoring activities by the International Atomic Energy Agency and UNSCOM.      (11) On August 14, 1998, President Clinton signed Public Law 105-235, which declared that `the Government of Iraq is in material and unacceptable breach of its international obligations' and urged the President `to take appropriate action, in accordance with the Constitution and relevant laws of the United States, to bring Iraq into compliance with its international obligations.'.      (12) On May 1, 1998, President Clinton signed Public Law 105-174, which made $5,000,000 available for assistance to the Iraqi democratic opposition for such activities as organization, training, communication and dissemination of information, developing and implementing agreements among opposition groups, compiling information to support the indictment of Iraqi officials for war crimes, and for related purposes.  You can perhaps understand why this point of O'Neill's about this being the first priority of the Bush Administration fell off the newspaper front pages rather quickly... Almost as quickly as the bit about the lack of evidence of WMD.  Indeed, the Democrats, and thereby, the news media, have dropped all references to Paul O'Neill. As this is written, it's Saturday afternoon, and the Sunday Morning news show schedules are still pretty much in flux. However, I'm willing to bet that nobody makes any mention of him at all. Apparently, they sense that they got caught, and they're not about to risk more exposure. As I glance through the various wire services this morning, I can find no reference to Mr. O'Neill at all, more recent than the morning of January 15th.  Some Democrats are wondering what hit them, today. Others are loudly suggesting (sans  evidence, of course) that O'Neill was intimidated by the Bush Administration into silence.  Well, you just knew the Democrats were going to try to say that Bush was silencing a Whistle- Blower, rather than they'd overstated their case, and stretched O'Neill's intent, didn't you, really? I have some serious doubts on that score, however. First, because such facts would soon get out to a press desperate to effect the removal of Mr. Bush from office.   Secondly, Mr. O'Neil is a hard bitten businessman, with plenty of financial resources of his own to bring into play, and at this stage of his life, little to lose. This is a guy known to have gone toe to toe with Vice President Dick Cheney in the past. I doubt Rove would have much effect on him.  But still for at least a while, the speculation kept coming from the left as regards why the sudden change on the part of Mr. O'Neill. Chief among the speculations, was that Mr. Bush had clamped down on a whistle-blower.  Think about it; what else are they going to say? They've been trying to say all along that Bush made up the whole Iraq conflict... and nothing else they could have said in this O'Neill situation would have aided their larger case. In fact, saying anything else...anything, exposes them to how badly overstated the left's case on this point really is. And what does O'Neill himself say on the matter? Asked if he thought the internal Treasury probe was a get-even move by the administration, O'Neill replied      'I don't think so. If I were secretary of the treasury and these circumstances occurred, I would have asked the inspector general to look into it.'  The silence from the left after this one took on monumental proportions. What they saw as one of the biggest weapons they had in this election, had blown up in their faces.  To further the point of how integral this attempted 'he made it up' story is to the Democrats, and how overstated it is, I refer again to Mr. Kennedy's speech of the other day, and the 1998 bill he voted for. I again refer to the series of MOVEON ads and gatherings, where this point is hammered at again and again. You remember those... the ones where Hitler gets invoked repeatedly.  The Democrats decided to use O'Neill for their own ends to spread this lie. They had to twist his words and intentions to do it, but no matter for that.  Thing is, O'Neill backfired on them, which I found amusing. For all the charges of how he's backtracking now, the fact is, he's not backtracking. He's simply telling the truth... something which apparently Suskind wouldn't let him do in the book, for reasons of his own. In short O'Neill's ghost-writer got out of control. Indeed, he's on record as stating he 'probably' would vote for Mr. Bush for a second term, adding that      ''I don't see anyone who is better prepared or more capable'  One e-mail writer to my blog the other day put it very well:      'O'Neill now presents the picture of a man being manipulated for political gain by the Democrats and finally standing up for himself, and speaking for himself.'  So, as a direct result of that truth telling, Mr. O'Neill's face is removed from the 'News' papers and TV sets of the world to languish in the obscurity brought on by having revealed, even if unwittingly, how far the left and the press are willing to leave the truth behind, to regain their hold on American politics.     Now, as to Suskind himself, and his inability to tell the truth, well, that's the final straw.   Suskind claimed in the relentless promotion of this sham, that he has documents showing that preparations for the Iraq war were well underway before 9-11. He cited--and even showed--what he said was a Pentagon document, entitled, ’Foreign Suitors for Iraq Oilfield Contracts.’ He claimed the document was about planning for post-war Iraq oil.  While his assertion is correct, for the reasons I've already listed, his supposed proof is in fact a lie.  The document was in fact from the Vice- President’s Office, and was part of the Energy Project that was the focus of Dick Cheney’s attention before 9/11. It had no connection at all with the war effort but was, rather, part of a study of global oil supplies, of which Iraq was only a part.  Judicial Watch has it available.    Drudge in fact had the link up before the echo died on the initial story. (By the way, this is why the investigation by the Administration; not to chase O'Neill, but to disprove the claim.)  This O'Neill business, and the Democrats trying to use him as a tool against President Bush should put to rest the question of who is telling the truth on Iraq and a number of other matters.... but it won't. The reasons simple enough, and clearly seen by their actions over the last several months...; The Democrats clearly don't have anything but their anger and their lies to offer as reasons for their being elected.          ",5696,1000,Rochester NY Let's start out with basic fact The Democrats are electoral trouble serious electoral trouble The polling data over the last six months and longer clearly and consistently places President Bush several dozen percentage points over any rival the Democrats can come up with including Hillary Clinton So you can imagine their glee when Paul O'Neill stepped into the spotlight having been pushed by Ron Suskind The book Suskind wrote The Price of Loyalty George W Bush the White House and the Education of Paul O'Neill must have seemed the right tool at the right time The press dealing with small news cycles in Iraq and the ungodly boring events in Iowa which everyone suspects will in the end be meaningless was looking for some spark and hoping they could fan it into a flame to burn down the Presidency of one George W Bush O'Neill looked to be the match to star this fire It amazes me the short memory that the left has It was just two short years ago that he was the brunt of jokes from the left Now suddenly they take him seriously Why Because he's giving them something to chew on other than their own recent failings Immediately and predictably the leftist hacks started working on out of context and twisted quotes from Mr O'Neill Said one such hack Like a blind man in a roomful of deaf people That certainly captured my attention DUH-Be-Ya's own ex-secretary of the Treasury describing Baby Bush's clueless demeanor at a Cabinet meeting But was it really so No this is leftist dominated news media twists because what O'Neill really said was that HE felt like Like a blind man in a roomful of deaf people not that Mr Bush was acting that way He was complaining in short that he felt disconnected from the processes of the White House Let's look at the bigger lines the Democrats and the press A redundancy seized upon O'Neill had seen no evidence of WMD in Iraq and from day one the Bush Administration was hell-bent on deposing Saddam Well it didn't take too much thinking to notice a little problem O'Neill is complaining he's out of the loop and yet we're supposed to take his seeing no evidence of WMD to mean that WMD do not exist in Iraq The Bush administration from Day one wanted Saddam out of power and was willing to do what it needed to do to make that happen Ted Kennedy made a speech the other day trying to sell the same dishwater That Mr Bush had made the whole thing up the act was illegal and so on The Democrats are focused like a laser on this point because they know it to be their only hope to regain power Well perhaps Democrats have shorter memories than the rest of us or perhaps they're just not wanting to tell us the truth But I seem to recall something called the Iraq Liberation Act of which was passed by the house with a large majority and unanimously by the Senate Meaning Kennedy voted for regime change in Iraq in He may have been drunk at the time and may not remember it but he voted for it The act as passed and signed into law by President Clinton declares that it should be the policy of the United States to seek to remove the Saddam Hussein regime from power in Iraq and to replace it with a democratic government So it appears Mr Bush was obeying the law If we're to believe with the Democrats that all this is Mr Bush's doing we also then think as the Colorado Conservative notes in his blog that Bush is SOOOOO Evil that he was able to enact regime change in Iraq TWO YEARS BEFORE HE WAS ELECTED FOUR YEARS BEFORE THE ACTUAL WAR I should also point up that one complaint from the left was that Bush went into Iraq with no plan Now he's tried and convicted in the press of doing what the Democrats wanted...following a pre-set well thought out plan in fact he was planning it all along Which way are they going with this But let's look closer at this claim of President Bush making it all up let's look at what the Congress had to say on the point also by way of Colorado's site The Congress makes the following findings On September Iraq invaded Iran starting an year war in which Iraq employed chemical weapons against Iranian troops and ballistic missiles against Iranian cities In February Iraq forcibly relocated Kurdish civilians from their home villages in the Anfal campaign killing an estimated to Kurds On March Iraq used chemical weapons against Iraqi Kurdish civilian opponents in the town of Halabja killing an estimated Kurds and causing numerous birth defects that affect the town today On August Iraq invaded and began a month occupation of Kuwait killing and committing numerous abuses against Kuwaiti civilians and setting Kuwait's oil wells ablaze upon retreat Hostilities in Operation Desert Storm ended on February and Iraq subsequently accepted the ceasefire conditions specified in United Nations Security Council Resolution April requiring Iraq among other things to disclose fully and permit the dismantlement of its weapons of mass destruction programs and submit to long-term monitoring and verification of such dismantlement In April Iraq orchestrated a failed plot to assassinate former President George Bush during his April visit to Kuwait In October Iraq moved troops to areas near the border with Kuwait posing an imminent threat of a renewed invasion of or attack against Kuwait On August Iraq suppressed many of its opponents by helping one Kurdish faction capture Irbil the seat of the Kurdish regional government Since March Iraq has systematically sought to deny weapons inspectors from the United Nations Special Commission on Iraq UNSCOM access to key facilities and documents has on several occasions endangered the safe operation of UNSCOM helicopters transporting UNSCOM personnel in Iraq,94,test
332,332,1604072,1,47,"           Today, we were greeted with the sad news, that The Gipper, the Greatest President of the 20th century, Ronald Reagan, is gone from us.   Today, we remember a man, whose mind was filled with wide visions and positive actions.      The central figure in pulling down the iron curtain and ending the cold war...   The man who brought the 20th century to a close with America as the sole superpower...   The man who reminded America that it IS good, that freedom, a belief in God and personal responsibility are good things to be encouraged and cherished…   The man who exposed to us the great evil that communism represents, in all it’s forms....   The man who created the longest peacetime economic expansion in America’s history...   This great man of vision has for the last several years had those visions restricted to his room, and another days breathing, having been in seclusion on his BelAir home since the revelation in 1994 that he was suffering with Alzheimer’s.   In truth, at age 93, he’s now been on a long trip toward the exit for several years, and likely would have been anyway without the Alzheimer’s. The picture grew steadily worse, with him having fallen in the bedroom back in January 2001, and suffered a broken hip. He has been frail and bedridden ever since. He spent his time since then being fed, washed and cared for 24 hours a day by medical staff. Grand care, by a loving staff, I am sure, but he could not leave his bed, even for the most basic of functions. Nor could he make himself understood.   The specter of one whose spirit so positively affected us all, to be so trapped for so long, is hurtful to each of us, individually and as a nation, and as a culture. But, perhaps it will help us to remember, first, that that great mind, that great spirit, is now free again.   It will also help, I think to remember his words; he was a far more eloquent speaker than myself, after all. It is, perhaps somewhat symbolic that Mr. Reagan should pass on, on the day marking the 60th anniversary of D-day. It was on this day in 1984, that Mr. Reagan remarked:      'Mr. President, distinguished guests, we stand today at a place of battle, one that 40 years ago saw and felt the worst of war. Men bled and died here for a few feet of--or inches of sand, as bullets and shellfire cut through their ranks. About them, General Omar Bradley later said, 'Every man who set foot on Omaha Beach that day was a hero.'   No speech can adequately portray their suffering, their sacrifice, their heroism. President Lincoln once reminded us that through their deeds, the dead of battle have spoken more eloquently for themselves than any of the living ever could. But we can only honor them by rededicating ourselves to the cause for which they gave a last full measure of devotion.   Today we do rededicate ourselves to that cause. And at this place of honor, we're humbled by the realization of how much so many gave to the cause of freedom and to their fellow man.   Some who survived the battle of June 6, 1944, are here today. Others who hoped to return never did.   'Someday, Lis, I'll go back,' said Private First Class Peter Robert Zanatta, of the 37th Engineer Combat Battalion, and first assault wave to hit Omaha Beach. 'I'll go back, and I'll see it all again. I'll see the beach, the barricades, and the graves.'   Those words of Private Zanatta come to us from his daughter, Lisa Zanatta Henn, in a heartrending story about the event her father spoke of so often. 'In his words, the Normandy invasion would change his life forever,' she said. She tells some of his stories of World War II but says of her father, 'the story to end all stories was D-Day.'   'He made me feel the fear of being on that boat waiting to land. I can smell the ocean and feel the seasickness. I can see the looks on his fellow soldiers' faces--the fear, the anguish, the uncertainty of what lay ahead. And when they landed, I can feel the strength and courage of the men who took those first steps through the tide to what must have surely looked like instant death.'   Private Zanatta's daughter wrote to me: 'I don't know how or why I can feel this emptiness, this fear, or this determination, but I do. Maybe it's the bond I had with my father. All I know is that it brings tears to my eyes to think about my father as a 20-year-old boy having to face that beach.'   The anniversary of D-Day was always special for her family. And like all the families of those who went to war, she describes how she came to realize her own father's survival was a miracle: 'So many men died. I know that my father watched many of his friends be killed. I know that he must have died inside a little each time. But his explanation to me was, 'You did what you had to do, and you kept on going.''   When men like Private Zanatta and all our Allied forces stormed the beaches of Normandy 40 years ago they came not as conquerors, but as liberators. When these troops swept across the French countryside and into the forests of Belgium and Luxembourg they came not to take, but to return what had been wrongly seized. When our forces marched into Germany they came not to prey on a brave and defeated people, but to nurture the seeds of democracy among those who yearned to be free again.   We salute them today. But, Mr. President, we also salute those who, like yourself, were already engaging the enemy inside your beloved country--the French Resistance. Your valiant struggle for France did so much to cripple the enemy and spur the advance of the armies of liberation. The French Forces of the Interior will forever personify courage and national spirit. They will be a timeless inspiration to all who are free and to all who would be free.   Today, in their memory, and for all who fought here, we celebrate the triumph of democracy. We reaffirm the unity of democratic peoples who fought a war and then joined with the vanquished in a firm resolve to keep the peace.   From a terrible war we learned that unity made us invincible; now, in peace, that same unity makes us secure. We sought to bring all freedom-loving nations together in a community dedicated to the defense and preservation of our sacred values. Our alliance, forged in the crucible of war, tempered and shaped by the realities of the postwar world, has succeeded. In Europe, the threat has been contained, the peace has been kept.   Today the living here assembled--officials, veterans, citizens--are a tribute to what was achieved here 40 years ago. This land is secure. We are free. These things are worth fighting and dying for.   Lisa Zanatta Henn began her story by quoting her father, who promised that he would return to Normandy. She ended with a promise to her father, who died eight years ago of cancer: 'I'm going there, Dad, and I'll see the beaches and the barricades and the monuments. I'll see the graves, and I'll put flowers there just like you wanted to do. I'll feel all the things you made me feel through your stories and your eyes. I'll never forget what you went through, Dad, nor will I let anyone else forget. And, Dad, I'll always be proud.'   Through the words of his loving daughter, who is here with us today, a D-Day veteran has shown us the meaning of this day far better than any President can. It is enough for us to say about Private Zanatta and all the men of honor and courage who fought beside him four decades ago: We will always remember. We will always be proud. We will always be prepared, so we may always be free.'     Here's a few that caught my eye today:       'I've spoken of the “Shining City on the Hill” all my political life, but I don't know if I ever quite communicated what I saw when I said it. But in my mind it was a tall proud city built on rocks stronger than oceans, wind-swept, God-blessed, and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace, a city with free ports that hummed with commerce and creativity, and if there had to be city walls, the walls had doors and the doors were open to anyone with the will and the heart to get here. That's how I saw it and see it still.   And how stands the city on this winter night? More prosperous, more secure, and happier than it was eight years ago. But more than that; after 200 years, two centuries, she still stands strong and true on the granite ridge, and her glow has held steady no matter what storm. And she's still a beacon, still a magnet for all who must have freedom, for all the pilgrims from all the lost places who are hurtling through the darkness, toward home.   We've done our part. And as I walk off into the city streets, a final word to the men and women of the Reagan revolution, the men and women across America who for eight years did the work that brought America back. My friends: We did it. We weren't just marking time. We made a difference. We made the city stronger. We made the city freer, and we left her in good hands. All in all, not bad, not bad at all..... '   ...'“Whatever else history may say about me when I’m gone, I hope it will record that I appealed to your best hopes, not your worst fears; to your confidence rather than your doubts. My dream is that you will travel the road ahead with liberty’s lamp guiding your steps and opportunity’s arm steadying your way....”  'And so, good-bye, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. '     Farewell, Mr. President. Ya done good.   Rest, now.

335,335,1604072,1,47,"           The Democrats started 2001 smelling blood in the water, and like any mindless shark, started snapping at anything that moved. As they start 2002, though it's looking more and more like the blood they smelled was their own. It's just that quite a few of them, like the sharks they are, don't know it yet.  They started this year of their campaign against Mr. Bush by challenging his legitimacy as president, claiming that Bush really lost the 2000 election and so shouldn't have been in the White House at all. According to these people, it belonged to Gore... even when Gore was sounding rather relieved to have not made it in. Then during the summer, the big deal was punishing Bush and the 'thieving' Republicans in the 2002 elections  More recently, it's had the undercurrent of that 2002 win pushing Bush out in 2004. These attacks have gotten so brazen and bizarre, that we are seeing indications that the Democrats plan to demonize conservative Christians as being like the Taliban, according to an article in Newsweek. All in the name of tolerance, of course.  Howard Fineman, in the NEWSWEEK, writes: Democrats 'are planning a daring assault on the most critical turf in politics: the cultural mainstream' ..... ' The theory goes like this. Our enemy in Afghanistan is religious extremism and intolerance. It's therefore more important than ever to honor the ideals of tolerance ? religious, sexual, racial, reproductive ? at home. The GOP is out of the mainstream, some Democrats will argue [this] year, because it's too dependent upon an intolerant 'religious right,'' Mr. Fineman says.    'This is an incendiary battle plan... essentially comparing the GOP right with the Taliban... designed to draw an outraged response from the president. Then Democrats would have Bush just where they wanted him: in a firefight at home.'    Fineman has obviously not been reading Usenet, and some of the other political forums on the net, because that nonsense has been going on in there since Gore finally admitted Bush won. The usual suspects are getting more strident as they find themselves taken out of the realm of validity. But you're always going to get that in Usenet.  But the net is hardly the only place. Consider Laura Conway of the 'Village Voice': 'Progressives spent much of 2001 getting punched in the nose again and again and again... all the way from the crushing denouement of Bush-Gore-Nader to the collapse of a visible anti-war movement. We lost on tactics, principles and PR. The year opened with a few thousand protesters straining to be heard at the crowning of an illegitimate president and ended with 90 percent of the country ... and no small number of progressives... backing that president's military machine. As if understanding that the left is losing the fight badly, the Village Voice wails:     'The left can ... and must... get up off the mat. The bell is ringing and the fight is now.'     What is happening here is that America is beginning to understand that what the left has been executing is an attack on American culture. This understanding existed , even before 9/11 but certainly after it. It's not been until 9/11 that we as a people understood just how important that cultural base is, and how low the American left has been bending so as to attack it.  With all that Democrat partisanship as a backdrop, the left now decides to puke up charges about Bush's involvement with Enron. But as usual, the left can't seem to see the facts, so blinded are they by their desire for revenge. Consider the linkages:   Enron does fine for years, under Clinton. Under Bush they go under? Just what is Enron supposed to have gotten under Bush, anyway? Here's a clue: Other energy companies fell the same way and most often and hardest in the states where energy companies are most closely regulated. Such as Democrat - dominated California. So, Bush gets the blame? Well, let's see... Under the Clinton administration, what would have kept Enron afloat? On Nov. 22, 1995 President Clinton scrawled an FYI note to chief of staff Mack McLarty, enclosing a newspaper article on Enron Corp. and the vicissitudes of its $3 billion power-plant project in India.  ..... McLarty then reached out to Enron's chairman, Ken Lay, and over the next nine months closely monitored the project with the U.S. ambassador to New Delhi, keeping Lay informed of the Administration's efforts, according to White House documents  reviewed by TIME magazine. ...... In June 1996, four days before India granted final approval to Enron's controversial $3 billion power-plant project, Enron's gave $100,000 to President Clinton's party. ...... Enron denies that its gift was repayment for Clinton's attention, and White House special counsel Lanny Davis says McLarty acted out of concern for a major U.S. investment overseas, TIME's Michael Weisskopf reported.  And of course, Enron later hired McLarty. Lay played golf with President Bill Clinton and slept in the Clinton White House. Lay served as an adviser to the Clinton White House on energy issues. So, Clinton did what the left is now complaining aout with Bush. The difference is, there's documented evidence that the Clinton administration, in turn, helped Enron get a contract for a gas pipeline in Mozambique and other projects, according to many, many reports..  And Clinton wasn't alone in taking the money. What kind of donations did Enron cough up to the Democrats in Congress?

An agenda, perhaps?  And of course, let's recall, shall we, that the Congressional leftists in the Congress weren't alone, here. Gregg Simon, Jack Quinn, and Johnny Hayes were all Gore advisors, and all took cash from Enron, while in that capacity. Remember these names; they will play heavily in any investigation into Enron. Bill Clinton did too, and so too, many other DNC candidates. Enron's two biggest donations to House members went to Democrats. The company spread its cash around in vast amounts, on the left. How much remains to be seen, and I doubt we will ever know. And the reason is simple: The accounting for it has been destroyed.  Recently stories about Enron accounting records that were destroyed have surfaced. What the press hasn't been telling you...at least as of this writing, is that the accounting firm, whose records were destroyed, were from the accounting firm Arthur Anderson and company.   Anderson is a company with a long history of supporting Democrats, with maximum money, and some reports place the amounts given well OVER the legal maximums. They also provided services worth millions of dollars, cooking up the books to defend Bill Clinton's nonsensical economic prattle. With this in mind, it's not hard to see why those documents have recent been reported as destroyed.  What did Enron get for all of those Democrat donations? There is much in the way of indication that Enron got special treatment from our federal government, both allowing, shall we say, non-standard budgeting practices, and international influence, in places like India, for example. Thing is, with the documents being destroyed, we'll never know.  Putting the links together, it's getting easier to see that this attempt to slander George W Bush by the Democrats will fail yet again, and will in fact backfire on them. I suspect and suppose the Democrats have dug their own grave. And like any body that's dying, some parts just don't know it yet.  Others seem to, however. Says the Washington Post this morning:      'Democratic lawmakers are divided about how aggressively to investigate the White House's relationship to the implosion of Enron Corp., with an increasing number of party officials warning their colleagues against overreaching or showing too much glee in attacking a popular wartime president.'      I wonder if Tom Dashiele has gotten the message. If not, one could say the DNC is dead from the neck up, given that Dashiele is the only one who doesn't know his moves will kill the party, if he keeps it up.  If he does, he'll be doing the country a service for the first time in his overly long political career.         ",5848,1000,The Democrats started smelling blood in the water and like any mindless shark started snapping at anything that moved As they start though it's looking more and more like the blood they smelled was their own It's just that quite a few of them like the sharks they are don't know it yet They started this year of their campaign against Mr Bush by challenging his legitimacy as president claiming that Bush really lost the election and so shouldn't have been in the White House at all According to these people it belonged to Gore even when Gore was sounding rather relieved to have not made it in Then during the summer the big deal was punishing Bush and the thieving Republicans in the elections More recently it's had the undercurrent of that win pushing Bush out in These attacks have gotten so brazen and bizarre that we are seeing indications that the Democrats plan to demonize conservative Christians as being like the Taliban according to an article in Newsweek All in the name of tolerance of course Howard Fineman in the NEWSWEEK writes Democrats are planning a daring assault on the most critical turf in politics the cultural mainstream The theory goes like this Our enemy in Afghanistan is religious extremism and intolerance It's therefore more important than ever to honor the ideals of tolerance religious sexual racial reproductive at home The GOP is out of the mainstream some Democrats will argue this year because it's too dependent upon an intolerant religious right Mr Fineman says This is an incendiary battle plan essentially comparing the GOP right with the Taliban designed to draw an outraged response from the president Then Democrats would have Bush just where they wanted him in a firefight at home Fineman has obviously not been reading Usenet and some of the other political forums on the net because that nonsense has been going on in there since Gore finally admitted Bush won The usual suspects are getting more strident as they find themselves taken out of the realm of validity But you're always going to get that in Usenet But the net is hardly the only place Consider Laura Conway of the Village Voice Progressives spent much of getting punched in the nose again and again and again all the way from the crushing denouement of Bush-Gore-Nader to the collapse of a visible anti-war movement We lost on tactics principles and PR The year opened with a few thousand protesters straining to be heard at the crowning of an illegitimate president and ended with percent of the country and no small number of progressives backing that president's military machine As if understanding that the left is losing the fight badly the Village Voice wails The left can and must get up off the mat The bell is ringing and the fight is now What is happening here is that America is beginning to understand that what the left has been executing is an attack on American culture This understanding existed even before but certainly after it It's not been until that we as a people understood just how important that cultural base is and how low the American left has been bending so as to attack it With all that Democrat partisanship as a backdrop the left now decides to puke up charges about Bush's involvement with Enron But as usual the left can't seem to see the facts so blinded are they by their desire for revenge Consider the linkages Enron does fine for years under Clinton Under Bush they go under Just what is Enron supposed to have gotten under Bush anyway Here's a clue Other energy companies fell the same way and most often and hardest in the states where energy companies are most closely regulated Such as Democrat dominated California So Bush gets the blame Well let's see Under the Clinton administration what would have kept Enron afloat On Nov President Clinton scrawled an FYI note to chief of staff Mack McLarty enclosing a newspaper article on Enron Corp and the vicissitudes of its billion power-plant project in India McLarty then reached out to Enron's chairman Ken Lay and over the next nine months closely monitored the project with the U.S ambassador to New Delhi keeping Lay informed of the Administration's efforts according to White House documents reviewed by TIME magazine In June four days before India granted final approval to Enron's controversial billion power-plant project Enron's gave to President Clinton's party Enron denies that its gift was repayment for Clinton's attention and White House special counsel Lanny Davis says McLarty acted out of concern for a major U.S investment overseas TIME's Michael Weisskopf reported And of course Enron later hired McLarty Lay played golf with President Bill Clinton and slept in the Clinton White House Lay served as an adviser to the Clinton White House on energy issues So Clinton did what the left is now complaining aout with Bush The difference is there's documented evidence that the Clinton administration in turn helped Enron get a contract for a gas pipeline in Mozambique and other projects according to many many reports And Clinton wasn't alone in taking the money What kind of donations did Enron cough up to the

336,336,1604072,1,47,"           A Lott over Nothing     12-18-02 --Rochester, NY---   First, before I even draw breath, let me mention my personal position against segregation.  I take that off the table right now, because what I say after this will without a doubt be used against me, in an attempt to paint me as a racist, even with this statement up front. So be it; at least now, they have no excuse.  That bit of Political Correctness dealt with, it must be noted that Majority Leader Trent Lott’s situation is not justified by the facts. This is a completely contrived state of affairs... created by frantic Democrats, who are desperate to regain power, in any way they can.   Consider the whole situation, here. Democrats, who are still smarting at their unprecedented mid-term losses, search for a way to retake Congress. At the least, they want to be able to limit the power of the Republicans by slashing the leadership. So they look at the new Majority leader. Now, what would happen, if we painted him as a racist? This is by no means a new trick, for them. The race card has always worked before.  They see that Mississippi has a Democrat Governor, who will doubtless appoint a Democrat to the Senate if Lott quits, under the kind of pressure they can generate, given their wherewithal in the leftist press. This would place us back at 50/50 again in the Senate.   Lott’s comments about Strom Thurmond must have seemed a gift from Heaven. Oh, wait. These are liberal Democrats. Sorry. I meant to say a gift from Gaia.  'But.... Bit!' , I hear you say; 'Lott’s comments were racist!'   Were they really? Let’s examine this, by looking at what he's actually said, not what we're supposed to think he meant:     'I want to say this about my state: when Strom Thurmond ran for President, we voted for him. We’re proud of it. And if the rest of the country had followed our lead, we wouldn’t have had all these problems over all these years, either.'    Hmmm. No direct reference to segregation there. The people linking this to segregation are in reality those looking for an excuse to take offense, and at that, one has to do some serious digging. Talk about manufacturing a controversy!  Segregation as a problem of that day in 1948 aside, what was at the core of Thurmond’s run for the White House was strict constitutionalism. Yes, I expect there were many of the day who supported Thurmond on the issue of segregation. Yet, I think where the run got the most support was on it’s lean toward a strict constitutionalism. Meanwhile, where it eventually lost the most support, was with regards segregation. Regardless of how good the concept of a strict constitutionalism may have been, most Americans couldn’t get over the race issue, and Thurmond lost. Both the gain and the loss were justifiable.  But consider; It’s no accident that those who are against a strict ‘original intent' reading of the constitution call such a reading ‘racist’, and that… what do you know... these are the same ones ‘taking offense’ now.  I have no indication provided me by any available facts, that Lott, wasn’t speaking of the constitutionalism aspect of Thurmond’s 1948 presidential run. The assumption that he is making racist comments sells better, I suppose.  Perhaps it would help to note the words of Dick Morris:     “...one third of Mississippi  blacks vote for him, year after year. He took the lead in doubling funding for historically black colleges in Mississippi, sponsored the bill to make racially motivated arson a federal crime, broke the filibuster to get the Africa Free Trade bill passed and brokered the deal that led to a vast increase in federal Title I education aid and earmarked it for poor schools.  And he helped get the Congressional Gold Medal voted for Rosa Parks. “     Gee, a real reacist there, huh?  Further, a comparison or two is in order. I mean, let’s test this supposedly well-known Democrat sensitivity to racism, shall we?  Does nobody recall Slick Willy Clinton honoring William Fulbright? I don’t recall anyone, black or otherwise, lining up to take a stab at ol’ Bubba for speaking warmly of HIM, do you? I’ve even been unable to find any record of anyone within the DNC or within Congress raising their voice in objection.  And of course there’s the Grand Wizard, Robert Byrd, which no Democrat will EVER go after, regardless of the comments made. I recall like yesterday, his saying on Fox, that..     '…there are white niggers. I've seen a lot of white niggers in my time.'    Was he talking about whites who act like blacks, I wonder? Years after Byrd supposedly renounced the Klan, he wrote in a letter, he would never fight…    …'with a Negro by my side. Rather I should die a thousand times, and see Old Glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again, than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels, a throwback to the blackest specimen from the wilds.'     It was Byrd who fought against the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act -- an act which was supported by the supposedly racist Republicans – and fillibustered it for over than 14 hours.I wonder if he mentioned his little dog, Billy.  Byrd also worked against the nominations of the Supreme Court's two black justices, Thurgood Marshall and Clarence Thomas.  Certainly, his Fox interview alone is a greater and more direct offense than Lott’s indirect and unwitting connection in his comments to segregation. If using ‘Nigger' on a news program won’t get his butt booted out of office, much less the remaining racist history of Byrd, nothing will.  Michelle Malkin, who I find myself respecting more and more of late, accurately notes that if Byrd were a Republican:     'Maxine Waters and Ralph Neas and Julianne Malveaux and Al Sharpton and all the other left-wing bloodhounds who sniff racism in every crevice of American life would be barking up a storm.'    Yet, it is the supporters of such as Clinton, Fullbright and Grand Wizard Robert Byrd, who are going after Trent Lott on his supposed racism? Forgive me, but I smell a fish.  It gets even worse when we reflect on Byrd’s comments about Clarence Thomas…    ' I'm very sorry the matter of race was injected here, not in an effort to clear one's name but in the effort to shift the ground. And so, instead of making an effort to clear his name in the minds of the committee members and in the minds of other senators who are not on the committee, he shifted the blame to the process and to race prejudice. I think it was preposterous...'     Much the same could be asked of Byrd and his fellow Democrats, here.  And now we see chatter from Lott’s home state that the man being considered to replace him should he quit, is Clinton co-criminal Mike Espy. I must say, I’ve never seen so brash a coup.  Make no mistake; this was planned from the get-go. Evidence for this, comes right from my own hometown in Rochester NY, where the attack pattern of the Democrats is all too clearly established. The executive of Monroe County, Jack Doyle is suffering much the same fate as Lott. I've met Jack Doyle, and can tell you from even that minimal understanding, that the man is no racist.   urlLink http://www.democratandchronicle.com/news/1219story5_news.shtml   I'll post a little of this article, because the D&C is not known for keeping stories online for a long time, apparently having some kind of space issue on their servers.  More or less from the Article: (edits added to clarify for non-locals)   The comment in question was published Monday in a list of quotes (the Republican) Doyle and (the Democrat Rochester City) Mayor William Johnson . made about their frosty relationship and about governing. Doyle said: 'If there was a mayor that looked like me, it would be a whole different landscape.'  During the interview, Doyle was asked whether he meant it as a racial issue, but said 'No' and responded, 'If there was a Republican mayor, there would be no end to it. Do you know what this city needs? It needs a Republican mayor to go in there and clean the bureaucrats out and straighten this city out. This city is disassembling, it’s deteriorating. And I live in the city.'  Doyle is on record as commenting later: 'Any crass political effort to twist these comments into a racially charged statement is entirely inaccurate and can only be explained as partisan politics at their very worst,'  (I strongly advise you visit the D&C site, paying particular attention to the investigative links at the bottom of that web page… as long as it lasts.)  The pattern here is too obvious to ignore… after years of there being no worries about racial discrimination from the left, now suddenly, there’s a national crisis? The tming of this is questionable at best. Forgive me, but this is obviously a co-ordinated effort.. The Democrats have shown their hand… they will play the race card in this is desperate effort to steal power again, by any means they can… in this case dealing the race card they've been holding up their sleeve….   The card they won't play against their own racists, black, white, or whatever.

339,339,1604072,1,47,"              012504183137-- Rochester, NY -- &nbsp; With all of the attention being turned on&nbsp; John Kerry, perhaps it's time we examined him in some detail... and I don't mean his $90 plastic-looking haircuts. It's no secret that the majority of support for Kerry comes from people who don't know much about him, and from the hard left.      For all that John &quot;F'ing.&quot; Kerry likes to lay claim to his Vietnam vet status, apparently most vets don't take him as such. Remember where he spoke at the Vietnam Vets Memorial and the vets turned their backs on him, and walked away as he spoke?        Perhaps it was his publication called &quot;The New Soldier,&quot; the cover of which is a photograph of his ragged band of radicals mocking the U.S. Marine Corps Memorial, which depicts the flag-raising on Iwo Jima, with an upside-down American flag. When he wanted to run for election to the U.S. House in 1972, Kerry decided to suppress reproduction of the cover picture appearing on his own book. The cover is a rare look at this man, and to this day, he won't let it be published. I'll post it here however.             Perhaps it was his group; &quot;Vietnam Veterans Against the War&quot; one of the most unabashedly anti-American groups to come to life though the period. As an example, Kerry and his group were in Chicago to disrupt the '68 Democrat convention. This group was founded and funded by Hanoi Jane Fonda.     Says the Pittsburgh Tribune Review:          &quot;In the last week of April 1971, some 250,000   protesters were in Washington for massive protests against the draft and the war. They were preparing for their attack on the U.S.government on May 4, when they hoped to shut down the capital. Kerry was everywhere, now promoting the pro-communist People's Peace Treaty, drawn up in East Germany and developed by Tom Hayden and Rennie Davis. The treaty advocated the communist line to withdraw all U.S.troops from Vietnam and then negotiate with Hanoi for the release of our GIs who had been taken prisoner.&quot;         That same week,  urlLink Kerry testified before Congress, basically supporting the North Vietnamese dictatorship's positions..      &nbsp; urlLink The group continue be as far leftist as they were then today.  Consider their statements about the September 11th attacks and you'll begun to see just how far out of whack these people are.          &nbsp;    Then, there's the small matter of Kerry having supposedly tossed his medals over the White House Fence at an anti-war protest...     Should we have as President, someone who demonstrably gave aid and comfort to the enemy?     Chuck Noe, in writing an  urlLink exploratory of Kerry,  reports:       &quot;Sen. John McCain revealed that his North Vietnamese captors had used reports of Kerry-led protests to taunt him and his fellow prisoners.&quot;      But about those medals he supposedly tossed away in protest...     &nbsp;New York Times columnist Bill Keller apparently pressed Kerry at one point about whatever happened to those medals. Keller was apparently interested to&nbsp; find them still adorning his office wall. Keller, to my understanding, no longer works at the Times.&nbsp; Wonder why, huh?           Kerry's affinity with the Communists, apparently still exists even today. Noe also reports:          As chairman of the Select Senate Committee on POW/MIA Affairs, created in 1991 to investigate reports that U.S. prisoners of war and soldiers designated missing in action were still alive in Vietnam, Kerry badgered the panel into voting that no American servicemen remained in Vietnam.          “[N]o one in the United States Senate pushed harder to bury the POW/MIA issue, the last obstacle preventing normalization of relations with Hanoi, than John Forbes Kerry,” noted U.S. Veteran  Dipatch.        His affinity with the Communists is not limited to North Vietnam. According to an article no longer online at Slate:           “On May 19, 1994, five years after Tiananmen Square, Kerry spoke on the Senate floor against linking China's Most Favored Nation trade status to its human rights record.   ”        Consider the small matter of Mr. Kerry lobbying for renewed trade relations with Hanoi Now why would he do that?&nbsp; Records show that at the time,&nbsp; his cousin, one Stewart Forbes, chief executive for Colliers International,&nbsp; was busily putting the finishing touches on brokering a $905 million deal, trying to develop a deep-sea port at Vung Tau. Such relationships would in the past have raised howls from the left about 'sweetheart deals'        &nbsp;   More than granted, his service to this country when he was in uniform was worthwhile, and should be praised. But I am reminded of the old Janet Jackson tune:  &quot;What have you Done for me Lately?&quot;        Vietnam Vets Against Kerry states it as best anyone could:          &quot;Kerry's betrayal of American prisoners of war, his blatant disrespect for Vietnam veterans and the military, his support for communist Vietnam and his waffling over the issue of use of force in Iraq proves he cannot be relied on to protect the best interests of the United States. Although Kerry voted to support military intervention in Iraq he is now claiming that he only approved the threat of force by the United States.&quot;         Now any such individual would certainly be altogether unworthy of the trust needed to be our Commander-in-Chief. But do not be trapped into thinking that his stands on the military and on world socialism&nbsp; are the only ones problematic. There are other inconsistencies which do not involve his military service, but rather bring to light questions about his sanity or his patriotism, take your pick.     Let's take the CIA for example. After President Reagan succeeded in ending the Cold War, Kerry made lots of noise complaining about all the money being 'wasted' on the CIA... money he complained could be spent on domestic socialist programs. But when these cutbacks were viewed in the light of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, he complained about &quot;the gross lack of intelligence capability&quot;.      What of the Flight 800 shoot-down?&nbsp; Kerry has never bothered to explain to us why he not once but twice.... twice... referred on the air to TWA 800 as a terrorist act. More, he never once told us why his Senate Select Committee on Intelligence failed to mention TWA 800 at all in its 1996 or 1997 reports.      Kerry, being honest for a change, appeared on the Larry King show the evening of 9/11/01 urlLink  (transcript)  and said, in part:          &quot;We have always known this could happen.   We've warned about it. We've talked about it. I regret to say, as I served on   the Intelligence Committee up until last year, I can remember after the   bombings of the embassies, after TWA 800, we went through this flurry of   activity, talking about it, but not really doing [sic] hard work of   responding.&quot;         urlLink But John Cashill of World Net Daily reports that            ...on Sept. 20, 2001, one mainstream newspaper   broke the story of how the so-called Gore Commission failed conspicuously to   address airline safety. The paper claimed that this failure &quot;represents   the clearest recent public example of the success that airlines have long had   in defeating calls for more oversight.&quot;         The paper traced that failure to a series of campaign donations from the airlines to the Democratic National Committee in 1996 in the wake of the crash of TWA Flight 800, donations likely solicited by Al Gore himself. That newspaper just happened to be John Kerry's hometown Boston Globe.              Cashill also points up that Kerry made this reference again. Read the link.     Here it is: Kerry KNEW about the threats posed against us, KNEW Flight 800 was an act of terrorism. Yet, he not only covered the facts about 800 up, but also then proceeded to distort the facts as regards the terrorist threats against us once Mr. Bush was in office. All for his own political gain, and that of his party.     Can you imagine anything like this getting by when a Republican is the culprit?&nbsp; Why is the question not being asked: &quot;What did Kerry Know, and when did he know it?&quot;      Even fellow Democrats admit inconsistencies exist.&nbsp; Consider a recent New York Times write-up:          &quot;When it was popular to be a Massachusetts   liberal, his voting record was that,&quot; said Jay Carson, a Dean campaign   spokesman. &quot;When it was popular to be for the Iraq war, he was for it.   Now it's popular to be against it, and he's against it. This is a voting   record that is a big vulnerability against Republicans in the general   election. He's all over the place on this stuff.&quot;        I find it interesting that none of this has shown up in the press in the past few weeks; almost as if they're reluctant to question him on these points.    Because the press isn't doing it's job, I had to dig up all of this from older WebPages and reference works. It was pretty easy to find, including the pictures... all of it, from the dateline to the end line.     Thing is, such searches are nothing that the supposed mainstream press couldn't have done,   had they bothered.   They didn't.      Now, ask yourself;   Why?       You know why.

346,346,1604072,1,47,"           022904141657- Buffalo, NY--  This afternoon, I'm in Buffalo with the family, doing a little railfanning. This spot, out along Broadway, is one of the big spots for rail traffic.  It's also the area of town that the Buffalo area band, The GooGooDolls sing about in 'Broadway's Dark Tonight'. Not exactly a high-rent district anymore, though this spot we're in is safe enough.   urlLink Here's a site with a lot of photos from the area.   The shots are mostly mid-90's vintage, pre CSX stuff when Conrail still ran the show. Most of what you can see is still there today.  As we wait for events to unfold, I'm struck again, by a comparison I saw drawn a couple days ago in one of the many online discussion groups I'm involved with. The idiot actually tried to compare John Kerry to Alfred Nobel. Apparently, this guy thought them both motivated by similar interests... peace, and they both had life changing events that led them in that direction. Too bad the person making that comparison is such a poor student of history.  When Alfred Nobel's brother, Ludwig, died in 1888 while doing oil exploration in Russia, a French newspaper of the day inadvertently published an obituary about not Ludwig, but Alfred, who in his turn was most famous at the time for having invented dynamite. The translated headline read, 'The merchant of death is dead.' One imagines what goes through the mind of Nobel as he read his own obituary. Ironically, Ludwig was blown up incidental to mis-handling his brother's invention.  There's not much in the way of supporting evidence to this, but it's suggested repeatedly among academics that this was a major turning point in Nobel's life, and forced him into the active pursuit of peace, and to found the peace prize that now bears his name.  urlLink Kenne Fant for example, in the book 'Alfred Nobel: A Biography' (ISBN# : 1559702222, Arcade Publishing, NY 1993)  notes that Nobel become so concerned about his legacy that he set about working to establish that legacy in a more peacful mode, establishing among other things, the fund that established the Nobel Peace Prize.  There are many among us who would suggest that Presidential hopeful John Kerry is not unlike Nobel, in having come to a juncture as regards military conflict and it's results, and worked ever after toward peace.  Of course this is the best of all possible spins, but how true is it? There are extensive records on both people and they tend to paint some rather different pictures which do not favor Kerry. as Kerry's supporters would have hoped.  First, unlike John Kerry, who was born into wealth and married into more of it, Nobel was born into poverty, in 1833, and worked his way out of it.... having amassed so many patents for inventions that only Thomas Edison had more.  Kerry's never had a job, never worked a day in his life, never has understood nor will he, how the working man survives. Nobel knew.   Nobel also never turned his back on country and on his comrades in arms as John Kerry did.... Never embraced the opposition as Kerry has done.  I don't doubt we'll see the comparison come up during the campaign, particularly as Kerry gets more desperate. Think I'm off base, here? Think again; how much on the Democrat side got invested in Jimmy Carter got the Nobel prize some years ago... ironic, given he did  more to bring about war with his capitulation than any President in history with the possible exception of FDR.  Josh Chafetz says very well over at Oxblog what I've been thinking for some days, now regards John Kerry:  'He's trying to claim that, because he's a veteran, any discussion of his views on national security is off-limits, even discussions about the way he has voted during his years in the Senate:  In a letter to Bush, Kerry wrote: 'As you well know, Vietnam was a very difficult and painful period in our nation's history, and the struggle for our veterans continues. So, it has been hard to believe that you would choose to reopen these wounds for your personal political gain. But, that is what you have chosen to do.'  Kerry was reacting to criticism earlier in the day from a leading Georgia Republican who, speaking for Bush's re-election campaign, predicted trouble for Kerry in the state's primary.  Sen. Saxby Chambliss said during a conference call arranged by the Bush campaign that Kerry has a '32-year history of voting to cut defense programs and cut defense systems.'  When Kerry responded later, at his side was Max Cleland, a triple-amputee Vietnam veteran who lost his Senate seat to Chambliss in 2002 after being portrayed as soft on homeland security.  He said the president 'decided once again to take the low road of American politics.'  Look, no one is attacking Kerry's record in Vietnam. He served honorably, and he, like every veteran, deserves thanks and praise from every American for what he did there. But that doesn't insulate him from criticism based on what he's done since -- his anti-war activities when he returned are fair game; his votes in the Senate are fair game; his statements on Iraq are fair game. Note that Chambliss' comment talked about a 32-year history -- 32 years ago was 1972 -- after Kerry got back from Vietnam. Again, no one here is questioning his Vietnam service -- they're questioning his political activity since he returned. And it's Kerry's attempts to foreclose these policy discussions that are taking 'the low road of American politics.'  However, I'll take it one step farther than Josh does, here. I WILL attack Kerry's Vietnam record,as many vets have... openly and loudly. After all, Kerry's the one who changed his middle name to 'Served in Vietnam', so his service, such as it is, is fair game as a target.  Kerry spent a total of four months in country. Four months.  During that time, he suffered three flesh wounds, two of them minor. When he got purple hearts for said injuries, they were given based on recommendations Kerry himself wrote. How many of US can be so fortunate as to write our own ticket?  Once he got his third Purple heart, he asked to be sent back stateside. This, he got, too. Again, the man writes his own ticket and dares call it 'sacrifice'. His field commanders had serious questions about his service to this country. Even Adml Elmo Zumwalt stated flatly that he'd have problems in his political carrier based on his experiences in 'nam.  Once he came back form 'nam, he then proceeded to sit down before Congress and outright lie about a number of atrocities, committed he said, by American servicemen there. Yet, he never witnessed them In short Mr Kerry LIED, and slandered his fellow servicemen.  But, as Josh suggests above... The real issue is what he did since getting into office. This, it seems was very consistent with his anti- Americanism since coming back from 'nam... Kerry is on record as having voted against every single Pentagon weapons program during his tenure in the U.S. Senate. Every single one.  And as for it all being with the intent of creating peace, tell me; why is it he never ONCE protested the actions in war that the Communists made? Or is it that he thinks it's only non-communist nations that foster war?  Further, look at the statements made by John Kerry's people this morning as regards the Rebels in Haiti; he'd have sided with the Communist backed Rebels.  All in the name of 'peace' of course.  This kind of selective weakness at best, and in truth, anti-Americanism, is something I want nowhere near the reins of power.  There's a name for his kind of actions... but that name certainly isn't 'Nobility', as some would have you think.  And it's certainly is not 'Presidential', either.

347,347,1604072,1,47,"           122103203203-Rochester, NY  A number of years ago, one of the justifications of getting involved in Vietnam was what was known as the Domino effect. In that case, the problem was seen that if we allowed Vietnam to fall under Communist domination, that one by one, all the nation-states of the region would also fall under communism.  Update to December 2003. President Bush has been saying for months that the removal of Saddam from power would not only help the Iraqi people, but would also start a domino effect in the region. We remove the Taliban, we remove Saddam, and woosh.... here comes Quack-Daffy, telling us he's going to disarm.  The latest domino falls, and this one didn't require a shot. Just as the President called it. Hmm.  As best I can tell the evidence is now irrefutable that the President's way of handling this situation is the correct one...  The resulting press is interesting, and telling. Even the usually leftist press is being forced to concede that Mr. Bush has been doing it right, after all.     A few examples:  Says CNN:      'Libya has declared its intention to dismantle its weapons of mass destruction and to limit the range of Libyan missiles to no greater than 300 kilometers,' Blair said, adding that the Libyan leader has agreed 'that this process will be transparent and verifiable.'      Libya also agreed to adhere to international agreements on chemical weapons and sign an additional protocol with the International Atomic Energy Agency, the nuclear watchdog group.      'This decision by Colonel Gadhafi is an historic one and a courageous one, and I applaud it,' Blair said. 'It will make the region and the world more secure.'  National Website of Wales which said in part:      'War in Iraq helped secure Libya's agreement to give up its weapons of mass destruction programmes'  British Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon Told Sky News, recently:      'I don't think you can separate out the relevance of military action in Iraq from the decision the Libyans have taken.      'We showed, after Saddam Hussein had failed to co-operate with the UN, that we meant business and Libya - and I hope other countries - will draw that lesson.'  The Japanese outlet, Asahi.com agrees, saying:      'Some observers believe that the use of military force against Iraq by the United States and Britain was also read as a warning to Libya, with that action paving the way to the current negotiations. It seems plausible that such a threat was one influence on Tripoli's decision to come clean.'  The Scottsman says pretty much the same:      '...nevertheless, the toppling of Saddam will not have been unhelpful in concentrating minds, both on the decision to abandon weapons of mass destruction and on the agreement to sign up to UN nuclear arms inspections. Such negotiations could have dragged on for many more months and years without yielding anything so dramatic as the developments of the past two days. It was perhaps no coincidence that Gaddafi approached Britain and the United States in March, at the very time when Saddam was being driven from power.'  Larger yet is the report from The Daily Times in Pakistan that with these agreements, comes also, intelligence on hundreds of Al Qaeda and other Islamic militants. Hundreds of terrorists have already been given up by Libya.   Given that there are ties between Bin Laden's group and Libya, it should not, perhaps be overly shocking to find that Libya's capitulation on the matter was apparently based on actions taken by the US, which in turn were started based on information apparently obtained by the capturing of Saddam.  The timing and some of the indications all seem to line up to that conclusion, at least as of this writing.  And what will France do, I wonder? Wasn't it France who tried to over-rule and negate the agreement with Libya last August, over the Flight 103 incident?  Reuters reports that:       France said on Sunday the United States told it months ago it was talking with Libya about giving up banned weapons, dismissing talk that Paris was frozen out because of its opposition to the U.S.-led war in Iraq.      Defense Minister Michele Alliot-Marie said France was kept informed of discussions between Washington, London and Tripoli which culminated in a surprise announcement on Friday that Libya was giving up its banned weapons programs.  Amazing. Sounds like these French have been taking lessons at the feet of one Bill Clinton... who has a habit of resisting to the last, and then when the situation gets out of his control, and what he was resisting finally happens anyway, he'd get out front and claim it was his idea all along. (Take, welfare reform as an example.) Even at this, however, even the French are being forced to admit progress in spite of, not because of their efforts at holding back the US. Says Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin:      'We are seeing the emergence, after what has been achieved in Iran and in Libya, of a coherent and willful international approach to tackle the problem of proliferation, which is essential for the safety of our societies.'  I suppose the French to be playing along now, but should,be fully trusted... rather like Smeagol of the Lord of the Rings fame. They clearly have an agenda of their own and are still trying to steer matters. Whatever else is happening, however, that particular dog has been successfully called to heel for the moment.  Meanwhile, North Korea is keeping rather quiet about these developments in Libya, and says the Korean Times:      'The reclusive country's state media is also silent on the capture of former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and Iran's possible acceptance of comprehensive inspections of its nuclear facilities.      U.S. President George W. Bush voiced his hope Saturday that North Korean leader Kim Jong-il would accept international inspections for weapons of mass destruction, as has Libya done.'  This situation seems to also speaks rather loudly as to the effectiveness of the UN in controlling nuclear arms. Consider; that Libya has found itself in need of de-arming means it was armed... for years... with Nuclear weapons banned under the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty they were a signatory to. So much for the arguments about trusting the UN to deal with such matters. And so much also, for the malcontents here at home in the US trying to direct us toward the UN running the show. This situation shows that was a Nuclear attack waiting to happen.  But it didn't because the current occupant of the White House not only has some testicular fortitude the one he replaced did not, but also one that is a student of history.  History shows clearly treaties don't keep the peace... the only path to peace in this world is the judicious use of military force. Mr. Bush and his administration have the wit to see this truth, and are reaping the benefits of a possibly more peaceful world as a result of that truth, and it's resulting policy.  But of course the nine dwarves  here in the States won't like it. Particularly Dean, whose idiotic insistence that all this doesn't help our security at home, is going to be hanging over his head for the rest of his life.  In the very near term, he may be right, in terms of the possibility of further attacks against America and the west, as the Islamofacists get more desperate. Like any cornered dog, they're likely to lash out with what they have left. (This, I suspect is the thinking behind the Orange alert as this is written.) Nobody, however, can deny that in the long term, we're going to be better off.  And think; all it took was standing up to a couple tyrants. Do that and like Dominos, all the rest fall in line.

357,357,1604072,1,47,"           We are so often told by the news media and the left (Often a redundancy) that there is no left leaning bias within our fifth estate.  And certainly, they are honest, and do not spread mistruths for some advantage.  It's gotten to the point where it's become a large joke.  Well, the usual left-leaning suspects in the news world... CNN, the New York Times, and a few others, have all within the last few weeks, admitted to years of lying to us. Not just once... they admit readily they lied for decades, about conditions in Iraq under Saddam Hussein.  Yep. You may not have heard this one. You can understand why they'd be reluctant to tell us...  Indeed the usual leftists have been verrrrry quiet about this one. But apparently CNN’s chief news executive, Eason Jordan felt the need to unburden his soul, and has reported in an editorial in the TIMES that under his direction CNN  purposely failed to report Iraqi atrocities. While Jordan claims he was protecting his staff, a lot of people, journalists particularly, have questions and concerns that CNN was trading their lies for access. Ok, either way that swings, there's a number of major concerns.    Let’s ignore for just a second, the questions of Jordan's motivation (and there are several) to get this point out; the biggest role these news orgs have is being a watchdog, supposedly. We keep getting told this when they’re trying to attack… errr.. report on someone who isn’t leftist/socialist.  Assuming they are being true to their charter, the only action journalists can take against oppression, injustice and hate is by exposing it thereby forcing a reaction from the rest of us.   In short, their job is to REPORT.  CNN didn't.  If nothing else, CNN should have put up a disclaimer to tell viewers that the Iraqi government was controlling the actions of reporters, and thereby controlling the content of their reports to us. No, we were expected to take what they fed us as hard news.... that we were getting the real picture of what was what in Iraq. In short, CNN lied.   CNN, being the only really world news body, had a monopoly on the picture of Iraq being fed the world. And the world got ONLY what Saddam wanted us to see, without so much as a whimper of protest from a CNN that, were they being stonewalled in a non-socialist country, would have been raising world-wide hell.  As to what impact all this has had, nobody can really be sure.  One can only, in this situation, properly  gauge all the implications by saying 'what if'...  What impact on the U.N. debate of last winter might there have been, had CNN actually maintained that much touted watchdog role?  Can you imagine the reaction, both here and abroad,  had CNN actually reported then, as they did after the fact, in Eason’s words, that several Iraqi officials had told CNN that  “Saddam Hussein was a maniac who had to be removed”? Imagine the reaction of the much misunderstood Arab Street, had the news come out that Saddam’s son had planned to kill the King Of Jordan, as CNN now admits... Imagine  the reaction of the American public, for that matter. Do you think the leftist arguments against our removing Saddam would have gained even as much traction as they managed to? And finally consider the difference in the UN debates on the issue.  In their failure to report the gross human-rights violations by Saddam, and all the other damning information that should have been reported, CNN has systematically ignored that watchdog role. One wonders what would cause them to so dramatically shift from the traditional watchdog policy to looking remarkably like Bill Clinton’s “don’t ask, don’t tell”.  One also wonders if they were selling their silence for access, and what possible reason there could be for that; what purpose their silence could possibly have served. Certainly, it wasn't helpful in getting the truth out to the people. The price for their controlled access was that they became a part of the Human-rights violation conspiracy that was Saddam’s government. Is this the same CNN that fought so hard against government officials they saw as less than desirable on this side of the ocean? Something simply doesn't add up here. Perhaps a look at their other actions will give us a clue as to what was what.  In looking around the landscape on this topic, some things do leap right out.  Let's remember, this is the same news org that paid 30,000 dollars US for video tapes... videotapes that depict al-Qaida poison gas experiments, terror training and bomb-making, and then lied about that, blaiming a 'miscommunication' for the discrepancy. The Tapes, initially, were a feather in the cap for CNN, who made several nights of programming out of them. Fox news never covered those tapes. Their news exec, Kevin MacGee, explained it this way:  'we don't see much newsworthy in it,' said Kevin Magee, Fox's vice president of programming. 'You've got to be careful when you start paying for things'  CNN at that time, refused to identify its source for the tapes but to this day insists its money did not go to Osama bin Laden or his terrorist organization.  Fox's Magee says, however... 'We are at war. This is the enemy. Where did the money go? I'm not sure `trust us' is good enough.'  No kidding, Kevin, particularly in light of Eason's overlate admissions.  I’ve mentioned the Times and CNN, in particular because both these orgs were rather outspoken in their opposition to out invasion of Iraq.  One wonders, though, just why... why they were so adamant about our not deposing Saddam., given the horrible facts they now admit to us that they did know, and what they're not admitting to us, like where those tapes came from.   Gee... do you suppose.... could it be that Saddam was a fellow leftist..... being a founding member of the Socialist Baath party? Was this opposition just one more lie to be told to maintain their position in Iraq?   And, perhaps an even more frightening question: What else has CNN not told us about it’s leftist/socialist friends around the world? Like the aforementioned Bill Clinton, as an example.   Even assuming their motivations were not, as I suspect they were, Geo-political... the only option left here is that CNN was running a straight propaganda service for Saddam and his merry band of thugs. This is balanced news?  CNN has an undeniable effect on the other news orgs around the world. How much did their not reporting such matters, influence the other news orgs into thinking nothing was wrong?  Or, perhaps more seriously; how many others were following where CNN led, and were as a result unwittingly lying to us, and to what effect?          ",5600,1000,We are so often told by the news media and the left Often a redundancy that there is no left leaning bias within our fifth estate And certainly they are honest and do not spread mistruths for some advantage It's gotten to the point where it's become a large joke Well the usual left-leaning suspects in the news world CNN the New York Times and a few others have all within the last few weeks admitted to years of lying to us Not just once they admit readily they lied for decades about conditions in Iraq under Saddam Hussein Yep You may not have heard this one You can understand why they'd be reluctant to tell us Indeed the usual leftists have been verrrrry quiet about this one But apparently CNN’s chief news executive Eason Jordan felt the need to unburden his soul and has reported in an editorial in the TIMES that under his direction CNN purposely failed to report Iraqi atrocities While Jordan claims he was protecting his staff a lot of people journalists particularly have questions and concerns that CNN was trading their lies for access Ok either way that swings there's a number of major concerns Let’s ignore for just a second the questions of Jordan's motivation and there are several to get this point out the biggest role these news orgs have is being a watchdog supposedly We keep getting told this when they’re trying to attack errr report on someone who isn’t leftist/socialist Assuming they are being true to their charter the only action journalists can take against oppression injustice and hate is by exposing it thereby forcing a reaction from the rest of us In short their job is to REPORT CNN didn't If nothing else CNN should have put up a disclaimer to tell viewers that the Iraqi government was controlling the actions of reporters and thereby controlling the content of their reports to us No we were expected to take what they fed us as hard news that we were getting the real picture of what was what in Iraq In short CNN lied CNN being the only really world news body had a monopoly on the picture of Iraq being fed the world And the world got ONLY what Saddam wanted us to see without so much as a whimper of protest from a CNN that were they being stonewalled in a non-socialist country would have been raising world-wide hell As to what impact all this has had nobody can really be sure One can only in this situation properly gauge all the implications by saying what if What impact on the U.N debate of last winter might there have been had CNN actually maintained that much touted watchdog role Can you imagine the reaction both here and abroad had CNN actually reported then as they did after the fact in Eason’s words that several Iraqi officials had told CNN that Saddam Hussein was a maniac who had to be removed Imagine the reaction of the much misunderstood Arab Street had the news come out that Saddam’s son had planned to kill the King Of Jordan as CNN now admits Imagine the reaction of the American public for that matter Do you think the leftist arguments against our removing Saddam would have gained even as much traction as they managed to And finally consider the difference in the UN debates on the issue In their failure to report the gross human-rights violations by Saddam and all the other damning information that should have been reported CNN has systematically ignored that watchdog role One wonders what would cause them to so dramatically shift from the traditional watchdog policy to looking remarkably like Bill Clinton’s don’t ask don’t tell One also wonders if they were selling their silence for access and what possible reason there could be for that what purpose their silence could possibly have served Certainly it wasn't helpful in getting the truth out to the people The price for their controlled access was that they became a part of the Human-rights violation conspiracy that was Saddam’s government Is this the same CNN that fought so hard against government officials they saw as less than desirable on this side of the ocean Something simply doesn't add up here Perhaps a look at their other actions will give us a clue as to what was what In looking around the landscape on this topic some things do leap right out Let's remember this is the same news org that paid dollars US for video tapes videotapes that depict al-Qaida poison gas experiments terror training and bomb-making and then lied about that blaiming a miscommunication for the discrepancy The Tapes initially were a feather in the cap for CNN who made several nights of programming out of them Fox news never covered those tapes Their news exec Kevin MacGee explained it this way we don't see much newsworthy in it said Kevin Magee Fox's vice president of programming You've got to be careful when you start paying for things CNN at that time refused to identify its source for the tapes but to this day insists its money did not go to Osama bin Laden or his terrorist organization Fox's Magee says however We are at war This is the enemy Where did the money go I'm not sure trust us is good enough No kidding Kevin particularly in light of Eason's overlate admissions I’ve mentioned the Times and CNN in particular because both these orgs were rather outspoken in their opposition to out invasion of Iraq One wonders though just why why they were so adamant about our not deposing Saddam given the horrible facts they now admit to us that they did know and what they're not admitting to us like where those tapes came from Gee do you suppose could it be that Saddam was a fellow leftist being a founding member of the Socialist Baath party Was this,59,test
364,364,2186817,1,36,"            I’VE A FEELING WE’RE NOT IN KANSAS ANYMORE   I’ve been sick today.  Actually, I began to feel under the weather yesterday about 6:00pm, but thought that I would feel better once I ate something.  Yesterday was busy.  I worked most of the day on the files I plan to turn in Monday. February is looking to be a very good month in regards to business.  In the first week, our amount of business tripled.  Woo hoo!  I was also able to give a friend my writer’s group some good news about his loan for his first home purchase.  That’s always a good feeling.  I was in the laundry room yesterday, when the phone rang.  I heard 2F’s yelling from upstairs and ran into the den to pick up the phone.  It was Paul saying that he and Boo, AKA Andrew, but not as much fun to say, were leaving to go to Doug’s party.  I finished folding laundry and 2F’s came down stairs and asked why I didn’t come upstairs when he yelled.  I thought he was trying to get my attention to answer the phone, but in actuality there was no soap in the shower and he didn’t have a towel.  I changed clothes and then he was angry with me for not being ready to go.  I didn’t know we had an exact time to be ready and didn’t feel good, so I dropped it.  Doug is a friend of Paul.  They are both professors at a local university.  They are vessels of knowledge regarding public policy.  I’m not sure what that means per se, but Doug teaches economics.  He is an affable guy who loves soccer and beer.  He is one of those guys that you just want to be your best friend.  He and Paul have been friends for a year or two and that’s how Jefffifer was introduce to Doug.  There was a sizable crowd at the party when we arrived.  The kitchen/dining room/computer command center was upstairs.  I went downstairs to sit.  I thought that if I just rested a bit, I might feel better.    There was a couple on the sofa.  He was from India or Pakistan I believe and she was a red-headed American.  She just gave birth to their second child on New Year’s Eve.  The older daughter was involved with a piece of bread that seemed to take her through many ever-changing moods.  I listened to the husband speak in the familiar sing-song accent and wondered what it must be like to hear someone like me try to speak his language.  Do Americans have our own sing-song accent?  If so, is it country & western, rock & roll or Broadway?  A few minutes later, another professor that Doug works with sat down and we began chatting.  Her name is Michelle and she lives in East Atlanta, which is the neighborhood next to Grant Park.  She is originally from Austin and we were talking about Texas, her mother who originally financed her home at 12%, but doesn’t want to refinance because it would mean she would have to find a lot of paperwork and the house Michelle and her husband are renting in East Atlanta.  She was talking about looking to buy a home and I was about to give her my business card when Jeff called me upstairs to eat something.  I had some grilled chicken.    Doug kept trying to offer me beer and popsicles.  I think he might have been a wee bit drunk.  He was playing various CD’s in his changer and I lit up when I heard Kirsty MacColl’s  In These Shoes .  We instantly bonded over the song and I will name my first born Doug.  He even knew she had been killed while swimming with her children off the coast of Can Cun.  Then we moved on to other topics.  I remember something about me being an honorary scapegoat and something being blamed on me.  Some people are just too cute when they are drunk.  Paul was in rare form last night.  Paul is a friend of 2F’s that he made through work.  It is interesting to note that Paul did not know about me for several months, but once we met, it was love at first sight.  He is my verbal sparring partner.  Or is conceptual sparring partner?  We wax on about spiritual matters.  He finds my obsession with all things Bananarama and Kylie to be intriguing if not disturbing.  He owns a horse and can be found often times tripping the lights fabulous with Boo at Hoe Downs.  There was an interesting girl at the party last night.  We were never properly introduced, but I remember she made note of my lightening fast thought process which can connect two completely unrelated topics at light speed.  2F’s said, “Welcome to my world.”  I told her that 2F’s sometimes gets frustrated with trying to follow my mind sometimes.  We were discussing Outkast’s  Hey Ya!  and I mentioned that it reminded me of the Beatles  Twist And Shout .  She couldn’t agree.  I felt a bit self-righteous when I read an interview with Outkast in the  Atlanta Journal Constitution (AJC)  that described this ditty as Beatlesque.  I had no idea that this track was formed while driving around Interstate 285.  I forget how much music is created here in Atlanta.  Speaking of Outkast, we watched a download of a video called  Hey Ya, Charlie Brown!   If you haven’t seen it, you should do a Google search for it.  It is made up of various scenes from the Peanuts Christmas special set to the Outkast’s  Hey Ya!   The editing is phenomenal.   After we left, 2F’s is angry with me.  He thought that I spoke unkindly about him regarding being frustrated with following my thinking process.  He then brought up the soap and towel incident.  I told him that I still didn’t feel well.  He thought I was trying to change the subject, but it was just a heads up in case I blew chunks there in the car.  I was not feeling romantic last night.  I woke up in the middle of the night feeling the imminent feeling of an impending vomit session.  I remembered once that if you feel nauseated, you should visualize the color orange.  I did and felt better.  After about half an hour, I felt bad again and made the trek to the bathroom to projectile vomit into the toilet.  I waited, belched and then felt better.  2F’s woke and gave me some Peptol Bismol and a cold wash cloth, which I had actually been craving for some time.  He is so sweet… even if he sometimes becomes frustrated with trying to follow my train of thought.  I went back to bed and felt much better.  This morning my stomach felt better, but I felt achy and slow.  I hung around the house and then went to the grocery store.  I’m moving into the new stage of the South Beach Diet where I can have fruit again and some pasta and bread.  I almost thought I wasn’t going to make it home.  2F’s had gone to his niece’s birthday lunch.  I sent a cook book to her because she is starting to do catering.  2F’s said it was a hit.  I made some Campbell’s chicken noodle soup for lunch along with a piece of toast with mozzarella cheese, a Jell-o sugar free strawberry Jell-o cup and a Diet Sprite.  I felt exhausted and went to lay down.  I read a little from a book that I bought while I was home for Christmas.  I had actually bought this book for Kent back in 1986.  He really enjoyed it and gave it to me to read.  I didn’t remember much about it other than it was quite funny.  The book is  I’ve A Feeling We’re Not In Kansas Anymore: Tales From Gay Manhattan  by Ethan Morden.  My reaction has been interesting.  The characters are from the late 70’s although the book was published in 1983.  It was a different gay world back then.  The fact that they lived in New York resulted in further differences I’m sure.  All in all, I can remember that book depressed me when I originally read it.  I must have been 19 or 20 tops.  It painted a very cynical look at the gay world in some respects.  I am happy to report that my life did not turn out to resemble the book at all.  It’s actually a very good document of history and Morden’s writing style is quite enjoyable.  I was a little disturbed by references to life being over after 30 since I’m 36.  Excuse me, but I’m just getting started.  There is one passage from the Mute Boy that I would like to share with you.  Here it is:       “Right,” I said, after we had walked on a bit.  “I’ve been in New York for seven years and I’ve seen, I think, everything.  But did that really happen?”      Mac shrugged benignly.      “He gave you a quarter!”      “People like me,” Mac wrote. “I’m nice.”      “What’s the secret of nice?” I wondered aloud.      “Forgiving,” he wrote.  Finally, I came across two poems that I wrote several years ago.  Einstein is one I wrote about Mark, whom I sort of dated back in 1994.  We lived in the same condo complex and it was a very strange relationship.  I think there may have been alcoholism in his family because he was the most emotionally unavailable person I ever met.  In fact, his heart was like a black hole.  However, he was a very nice guy.  That’s why I kept hanging on.  It ended after I ran into him at a viewing of the aids quilt with his other boyfriend.  I wrote this poem a few weeks later as I tried to make sense of it all.   Einstein   I don’t know much about love In fact, The more I love, The Less I know  I know it is forever Though we go our separate ways  Love is matter And matter can never be destroyed  I thought our love was solid, But it must have turned to gas Perhaps we should have been more fluid  I sometimes with I could dig Einstein up And give him a trim and comb his hair I’d say, “Albert!  Albert! What is the meaning of love?!” But I guess he would just lay there  Trying to get an answer out of Einstein, Is like wringing water from a stone The water is your love for me And your heart is the stone  You don’t have to be Einstein To know you don’t love me anymore  I don’t know much about love, But the more I love, The less I know  The other poem was one I wrote was for my friend Joan back in October of 1996.  Her mom had just died after struggling with both lung and then brain cancer.  It’s how I imagined I would feel if I were in her shoes.  I thought I would share it with you here since Marti, her sister, had written about her mother on her blog, Ramblings Of A Redhead.   11:15   It’s 11:15 and my mother just died Passed away to the other side And although I’ve mentally prepared myself for weeks I know my heart is slow to comprehend  Perhaps one day it will catch up with me As I’m driving down the road to some happy place I’ll pull over to the shoulder and sob violently As my whole body shakes  While bent over the steering wheel  I’m glad she’s out of pain, But there is a selfish part of me that still wants my mommy To take care of me when I don’t feel well And kiss my skinned knees And be there for me when the world is a cold place to live in  Photographs don’t do her justice She has to be live, not Memorex  I’m exhausted from staying up all night with her And the weeks of waiting and wondering when, But my mind is still racing And there’s no way on earth to escape her memory  Holidays are unfathomable  The idea of life without her is awkward Like adjusting to a new piece of furniture And learning how to maneuver around it  I must have said, “I love you!” a million times, But now I wonder if a million was enough  It just occurred to me that the Grammy’s were tonight.  I wonder if Kylie won for  Come Into My World ?  Her  Body Language  album is on sale in all the big stores this week for $9.99 with two additional tracks not on my Australian copy.  Gotta have it!  The  Queer Eye For The Straight Guy  soundtrack is also on sale for $9.99.  I think I’ll have to get that as well because it has the Chemical Brothers remix of Kylie’s  Slow  and a Fischerspooner Vs. Billy Squier track.    I just checked CNN.com.  Kylie won!  YEAH!!!  Life is good.

372,372,2186817,1,36,"            IF THE PET SHOP BOYS SAID IT, IT MUST BE TRUE   Today was Martin Luther King (MLK) Day in the U.S.  Even though Martin Luther King Junior’s birthday was last Thursday, it is observed on the following Monday.  Today was the first time in many years that I had to work today.  It was very slow.  I got a lot done today.  I drove by the MLK Memorial on my way home.  It's the short cut I usually take to avoid traffic.  For the first time, I actually had to stop and let some cross the street at the pedestrian crossing.  Robert returned from his vacation in Panama.  He had a great time and now has the international travel bug.  Perhaps there will be an article in  Rolling Stone  about people who purposely try to catch the travel bug and there will be a big controversy.  I clicked on the link for  urlLink Geek Slut  on  Belle De Jour  this evening.  It took me a minute to figure out he was a man.  I got him confused with  Pussy Ranch .  He wrote about having unprotected anal intercourse with an HIV+ guy.  I found that rather disturbing.  This guy is having sex with a lot of people.  Granted, he didn’t have anal intercourse with the HIV- boy.  He seems to only have anal intercourse with HIV+ men from what I could gather and he seems to be the top in these situations.  From what I have read, if two HIV+ people have unprotected sex, they run the risk of infecting themselves with several different strains of the virus.  However, you read about these men that believe that HIV was just been planted in our collective consciousness by the government and it really doesn’t exist.  Oddly enough, these men never seem to get sick.  What if they were right?  I know a few gay couples that have been together for a while and do not have an open relationship.  They have been tested and they no longer use condoms for intercourse.  I understand the logic, but since I came out after this dis-ease was already around, it’s just not an option that is available in my psyche.  It’s interesting to notice how much the world is changing.  I read another few pages in  Kylie Confidential  today.  Did you know she dated Pauly Shore?  They met on the set for  Bio-Dome .  She then spurned him for the French photographer, Stephane Sednaoui, who previously dated Bjork.  I would assume that both Bjork and Kylie were sexually active with Stephane.  Therefore, one could say that Bjork and Kylie have slept together… indirectly.  I decided to visit the  urlLink Pet Shop Boys  Web site today.  I wanted to know when they were going to release their next single from  Pop Art , which is their compilation of all of their top 20 hits.  There are two new songs:  Miracles ; and  Flamboyant .  I really like  Miracles  and the B-side,  We Are The Pet Shop Boys  is a lot of fun.  When I visit the PSB Web site, I enjoy reading the questions and answers section where fans have posted questions and the PSB type their replies.  It is usually quite entertaining.  What I have always liked about Neil Tennant is that he just says it like it T-I-S.  For example, question 58 reads as follows:  Do you like the french football? Do you know Bordeaux?  Neil Tennant: No but I've seen the French rugby players calendar. N  Then I came across a fireball of controversy and bad punctuation in question 884.  Please see below:  Do you think kylie should go back to pop.  Neil Tennant: Yes. N  Oh the scandal!  Personally, I believe Neil and Chris are still a tad bit upset about Kylie’s recording of the song  Falling , which they wrote for her  Kylie Minogue  album from 1994.  Once again, she was trying to be a serious artist.  Speaking of Ms. Minogue, her new single  Slow  has received a warm reception from U.S. radio.  Her new album,  Body Language , will be released on February 10th in the U.S.  It will include two new tracks:  Cruise Control ; and  You Make Me Feel , which was also included on the Japanese version of  Body Language .  It will also include the videos for  Slow  and  Can’t Get You Out Of My Head  from her  Money Can’t Buy  concert in London last November.    In other Kylie news, she will make a guest appearance on a future episode of  Queer Eye For The Straight Guy  and will also be featured on the soundtrack, which will coincidently be released on February 10th as well.  It will include the previously unreleased remix of  Slow  by the Chemical Brothers.  In addition, it will also include tracks by Basement Jaxx, Junior Senior, In-Grid, Fischerspooner & Billy Squier, Duran Duran, Liz Phair, Sting and Elton John.  For more information, visit the  urlLink  Queer Eye For The Straight Guy   official Web site.  Finally, the last topic in the Kylie Department is that Kylie is jealous of Dannii’s  Kath & Kim  oven mitts.  Evidently they both have the apron, but Dannii has one up on Kylie in the mitt department.  (Ooh… that sounds nasty, doesn’t it?)  Who are  Kath & Kim ?  They are an Australian sit-com on ABC TV in Australia.  Check out the  urlLink Kath & Kim  Web site.  It’s very entertaining.  I like the nip and tuck page where you can perform virtual plastic surgery.  2F’s had the day off today and was very productive upstairs in the master bedroom, a renovated attic space.  He bought a lamp made out of an old upright telephone and wove a lamp shade out of raffia.  He then put old black & white photographs of some people that he doesn’t know into the lamp shade along with an old skeleton key.  It’s pretty cool.  I’m very proud of him.  I told my mom that he was becoming a regular Martha Stewart.  She replied, “Yeah, but look what happened to her.  Tell him to be careful.”  We picked up my box spring today.  Abby, the store manager, has one of those great looks and voices.  I decided that she should be on a sit-com.  Buddy is somewhat concerned about the new mattress and box spring because it makes the top of the bed about a third higher than it was before.  It’s almost like a hospital bed.  She really needs something to get up on to make it to the top since she only has one hind leg.  I guess I’ll have to build her a box.  Tomorrow is the photo shoot for our brochure.  We’re going to have some individual head shots made so at least I’ll have something to use if I do decide to audition for a play this year.  Many people have been pushing for me to return to the stage.  I always enjoyed acting and did quite well, but it is certainly a time commitment.  I was telling Patty at the office that I had a screen test for  Primal Fear  and she was quite impressed.  I’m not sure that there was any reason to be considering that Edward Norton received the part and an Oscar nomination and all I got was a slice of pizza from the director.    While cleaning out my bedroom this evening to make room for the new mattress and box spring, I came across a book called  The Visual Encyclopedia of Natural Healing .  I opened the book up and it happened to be on the chapter on flatulence.  If you know me, you know this is one of my least favorite subject’s in the world.  In fact, I just think discussing bodily functions of the excretory system are just taboo.  However, I was surprised to learn that young to middle-aged men pass gas an average of 14 times per day, releasing a total of about 2.5 cups of fumes.  I couldn’t help but visualize some poor little woman in a white lab coat holding a measuring cup over some middle-aged man’s behind.  There is also a diagram of a yoga pose that will relax your rectum so that you can release trapped gas.  Yet the most shocking thing to learn above all is that practically everything you eat, with the exception of fiberglass insulation, causes flatulence.  Here is the list of guilty foods: apples; bagels; bananas; bread; brussels sprouts; cabbage; carrots; celery; citrus fruits; eggplant; lettuce; onions; pastries; potatoes; pretzels; prune juice; raisins; and wheat germ.  In addition, coffee, soft drinks, beer and other yeasty beverages produce similar results.  The best advice they give is to avoid these foods completely.  Well, what’s left?  Buddy just hopped over to the stairs and has meowed at me that it is time to go to bed.  I’d better wrap up or she’ll be down in a few minutes to check on me.  She’s really quite intelligent as well as being down-right bossy. The nickname of Princess is well deserved.  I’ve been under a heavy British influence lately and have decided to start using “whilst” as much as possible.  You don’t believe me?  Whilst he or whilstn’t he?  That is the question!  I received a pleasant surprise today.  Drew from London sent me a nice note.  It’s always nice to make a new friend… especially when he is a writer too.  I had asked him previously about his disparaging remark about Debbie Harry.  His response was as follows:  “Oh, and Debbie Harry – well don’t get me started.  She still owes me ten quid… ;)”    I’m intrigued.  Tell me more.

he seems to be the top in these situations From what I have read if two HIV people have unprotected sex they run the risk of infecting themselves with several different strains of the virus However you read about these men that believe that HIV was just been planted in our collective consciousness by the government and it really doesn’t exist Oddly enough these men never seem to get sick What if they were right I know a few gay couples that have been together for a while and do not have an open relationship They have been tested and they no longer use condoms for intercourse I understand the logic but since I came out after this dis-ease was already around it’s just not an option that is available in my psyche It’s interesting to notice how much the world is changing I read another few pages in Kylie Confidential today Did you know she dated Pauly Shore They met on the set for Bio-Dome She then spurned him for the French photographer Stephane Sednaoui who previously dated Bjork I would assume that both Bjork and Kylie were sexually active with Stephane Therefore one could say that Bjork and Kylie have slept together indirectly I decided to visit the Pet Shop Boys Web site today I wanted to know when they were going to release their next single from Pop Art which is their compilation of all of their top hits There are two new songs Miracles and Flamboyant I really like Miracles and the B-side We Are The Pet Shop Boys is a lot of fun When I visit the PSB Web site I enjoy reading the questions and answers section where fans have posted questions and the PSB type their replies It is usually quite entertaining What I have always liked about Neil Tennant is that he just says it like it T-I-S For example question reads as follows Do you like the french football Do you know Bordeaux Neil Tennant No but I've seen the French rugby players calendar N Then I came across a fireball of controversy and bad punctuation in question Please see below Do you think kylie should go back to pop Neil Tennant Yes N Oh the scandal Personally I believe Neil and Chris are still a tad bit upset about Kylie’s recording of the song Falling which they wrote for her Kylie Minogue album from Once again she was trying to be a serious artist Speaking of Ms Minogue her new single Slow has received a warm reception from U.S radio Her new album Body Language will be released on February th in the U.S It will include two new tracks Cruise Control and You Make Me Feel which was also included on the Japanese version of Body Language It will also include the videos for Slow and Can’t Get You Out Of My Head from her Money Can’t Buy concert in London last November In other Kylie news she will make a guest appearance on a future episode of Queer Eye For The Straight Guy and will also be featured on the soundtrack which will coincidently be released on February th as well It will include the previously unreleased remix of Slow by the Chemical Brothers In addition it will also include tracks by Basement Jaxx Junior Senior In-Grid Fischerspooner Billy Squier Duran Duran Liz Phair Sting and Elton John For more information visit the Queer Eye For The Straight Guy official Web site Finally the last topic in the Kylie Department is that Kylie is jealous of Dannii’s Kath Kim oven mitts Evidently they both have the apron but Dannii has one up on Kylie in the mitt department Ooh that sounds nasty doesn’t it Who are Kath Kim They are an Australian sit-com on ABC TV in Australia Check out the Kath Kim Web site It’s very entertaining I like the nip and tuck page where you can

'It's an investment in a bright young future.'&nbsp; I smiled and I really wanted to stay the night.&nbsp; I didn't want to have sex.&nbsp; I just wanted to sleep beside him and keep him company.&nbsp;   I moved toward the door and stopped. I turned around and said, 'If you're ever in town again, you more than welcome to call me.&nbsp; I mean, you can call me directly.&nbsp; I'd be happy just to share your company at no charge.'&nbsp; His eyes smiled at me and he said, 'I don't know that my business is ever going to bring me back to Dallas, but... in another place and time, I would have liked to have met you.'&nbsp; I knew I'd never see him again, but it had nothing to do with me.&nbsp;   He opened the door for me and I turned to walk out.&nbsp; 'May I kiss you?' he asked.&nbsp; I turned to him and&nbsp;nodded.&nbsp; He put his hand under my chin and pulled my lips to his.&nbsp; It was a gentle kiss with a dash of passion that&nbsp;made my lips hum.&nbsp; When he pulled away, my hand instinctively went to my lips to touch them.&nbsp; I looked into his eyes and said, 'Thank you.'   He looked into my eyes for a moment and said, 'No, thank you.' Then kissed me on my forehead and I walked out the door.&nbsp; When I reached the end of the hall, I looked back before I turned and was still watching me.&nbsp; I waved and he smiled and waved back.&nbsp;   On the elevator ride down I debated about going back, but my gut said that was the way it should be.&nbsp; For some odd reason, I actually followed my intuition and went home.&nbsp; I called my friend to tell him I made it home safely and then went to bed.&nbsp; For the longest time I kept replaying the events of the evening. I could not believe I had worked as an escort for the evening and earned $120 for not putting out.&nbsp; Maybe there was hope for gaykind.  I went over to my friends apartment the next day and gave him the money.&nbsp; He was already tired of the boyfriend of the week and asked me how it went.&nbsp; I smiled and said that it went well.&nbsp; My friend asked if he tried anything and I said no.&nbsp; He counted the money and then handed me some back and then handed me an extra $20.00.&nbsp; 'What's this for?' I asked.  'He gave you a tip.'&nbsp;   I looked at the additional $20 and was amazed that out of nowhere I now had enough money to cover the bill.&nbsp; 'Why did he do that?&nbsp; He paid for dinner and my time.'  My friend smiled at me as if were a child.&nbsp; 'He enjoyed your company.&nbsp; That's how he showed his appreciation.' My friend tilted his head to the right.&nbsp; 'Are you sure nothing happened?'  'No,' I laughed.&nbsp; 'Why do you ask?'  'He called today and said that you were exceptional.&nbsp; No one has done that before.'  I smiled.&nbsp; 'Does he call you every time he comes to town?'  'Actually he was a new john.&nbsp; I'd never heard from him before.&nbsp; Do you think you may be interested in doing this again now that you see how easy it is?'  'No.&nbsp; I think I'd rather quit on a high note.&nbsp; I just wanted to help you out, but... if he calls you again, let me know.'  My friend looked at me suspiciously and I realized that he would never believe nothing happened so I left.  I never heard from the gentelman again and I lost contact with my friend about six months later.&nbsp; I think he moved to L.A. is what I heard.&nbsp; I wondered what happened to that gentleman and what his story was, but most of all, I hope he's doing well.&nbsp; However, sometimes I like to honor him when I have a college-age waiter who gives me good service and is personable.&nbsp; I'll tip more than I should as an investment in a bright future because there was someone who saw a spark in me when all I saw was blackness.

376,376,2186817,1,36,"            DALLAS 1992-1993   I moved to Dallas, Texas in 1992. I felt I needed to start over again. I had graduated from  UTA  the following year and was still living in a duplex near school with Chris, my roommate, friend and... something between fuck buddy and boyfriend. I basically had a nervous breakdown in the summer of 1992. The catalyst was finding a message from Chris' boyfriend on the answering machine. (And you thought that kind of thing just happened in movies.) At the time, I thought we were getting closer to a permanent relationship, but evidently I was mistaken. In reality, it didn't have much to do with Chris. I was nursing wounds from my family and my grandmother's death from many years before. Ultimately, I had a great fear of abandoment, which stemmed from a time when my parents separated and almost divorced and my grandmother dying on the operating table while undergoing bypass surgery. My grandmother was the most important person in my life and when she died, I was gutted. I just realized her birthday was yesterday.  I had opted for being laid off from  TRW , where I was working at the time, and did not accept their offer to move to Atlanta. (The irony is not lost on me.) It just didn't seem like it was the right time. I didn't feel like I could move to a new city where I didn't know anyone. Instead, I took a job at  JC Penney's  in a credit call center for  Saks 5th Avenue . Chris decided he wanted a change to and we moved together. In hindsight, it was probably not the best idea, but we had made a pledge to always be friends and be there for one another no matter what. Loyalty means something to me. We chose an apartment complex where fellow conspirators of Timothy McVey would be arrested a few years later.  The job at  Penney's  didn't pan out. The manager for the  Saks Fifth Avenue  credit division met me and decided she hated me. I know that sounds like something a kid would say, but it was literally what happened. I said good morning to her and her lip curled up. I had 100+ scores on my training tests and one day was asked to leave. At first I was angry because I had never been fired before and I called them on their bluff. The head of HR got nervous and I realized that it was a blessing in disguise. The place was like a Nazi concentration camp. People were written up for being late when there was a huge wreck on the freeway.  Suddenly without a job, I went and applied at  Today's Temporary  and was working the next day. This led to a temporary to permanent job for  American Eagle Aviation Insurance . I worked for a boy from Iceland named Thor. He looked like one of the children from  The Village of the Damned  all grown up. Thor liked me and inisted on getting right in my face to speak with me. He had very bad breath. I was always offering him gum, but he never took the hint. One day I swore I would feign being overwhelmed by the odor and pass out. I never did.  There was gray sense of melancholy that underscored my existence at that time. I made very little money and had a college degree that seemed worthless in the recession. Madonna's  Erotica  album was the big thing and I don't recall ever hearing any of the songs on the radio. I was far from Susan and Joan and the friends I did make in Dallas seemed very superficial. Chris was still seeing 'the boyfriend' occasionally. Susan and I finally got a look at him and we thought he looked like Floyd the barber on the  Andy Griffith Show  so we began referring to him as Floyd. Chris and I still maintained a consistent sex life just to make things really confusing for both of us.  I would sometimes go to the  Wave  with Colin and we would pick up abandoned drinks off the railing and offer them to people we didn't like. We eventually began spending time at the  Round Up  and before long I had a pair of ropers. I liked to watch the men dance together. After you adjusted to the shock of seeing men dance together, it really is quite beautiful. I remember watching one fellow in particular when the lights were down low as he two-stepped around the floor to Pam Tillis'  Maybe It Was Memphis . It was straight out of a movie and I fell in love with him. Some time later I actually met him and he had a very high voice and was very effeminate. This was not congruent with the picture I had created, but it taught me something. It's best not to fall in love with someone until you really know them. It wasn't his efeminancy that bothered me. It was the fact that I had constructed an entire illusion based upon my needs instead of just allowing myself to get to know someone's authentic self.  We used to talk to Randall, the doorman. He was funny and wise and taught me that I should never wear a straw hat after Labor Day. Randall smoked cigarettes that smelt like the kind my grandmother used to smoke. I don't like cigarette smoke, but I love the smell of when a cigarette is first lit. There was another boy that I used to watch. He was closer to my age, always wore a pager and I liked the way he chewed gum. Randall said he had a buiscit butt, flat and round.  I should have asked more people to dance, but I was afraid. I didn't feel that I danced very well even though I went to the lessons on Sunday evening. Kent danced very well and would stay on the floor all night. Our friend, Danita, came with us and I used to practive with her, but I soon became frustrated and quit. She always insisted on leading and had trouble with the turns. Danita was a big girl from Kansas and when we came to a turn, she would just pick me up and set me down again. It was very disporienting and I soon just had to say no.  I don't know when exactly it happened, but one day without saying it, Randall communicated to me that I needed to quit hanging out in a cowboy bar and talking to the doorman and live my life. He was pushing the baby bird from the nest. It was just in his eyes when he looked at me. 'You're young. You should be living not wasting your time talking to an old coot like me.' I moved on even though I liked talking to him.  In January of 1993, Kent was diagnosed with HIV and eventually full-blown AIDS. I was devastated. Donna, Michael and I gathered around him in his father's house. It got very serious and I asked him if I could have his couch when he died. Kent busted out laughing. No one understood because we understood each other in ways even we didn't know. I just knew he had become far to serious and I had to ground him with humor.  We had our own language like twins and our devotion to one another was matched by no one other than possibly a mama bear and her cub. After all, we had been friends since we were 13.  Kent spent a lot of time talking with Randall, who was also positive. I took time off from work to be with him. He started on medications and slowly began to return to his normal life. Meanwhile, the underlying depression that was already there was only further complicated by Kent's diagnosis. For the first time in my life, I had several mornings where I woke up and just didn't have the motivation to get out of bed. It drove me crazy to lie there, but it just didn't seem like there was anything worth getting up for. Things weren't getting better, they were getting worse.  To be continued....

I used to work at a daycare when I was a senior in high school 54. For extra money in high school, I used to help my sister, cousin and my dad mow the church grounds, which included the grave yard 55. I'm terrible at navigating footstones in a grave yard on a riding mower 56. I've held an alligator only once 57. I've petted a shark at the Aquarium of the Americas in New Orleans 58. I have never traveled outside of the United States 59. I've never been further West than Dallas & Houston 60. I've never been further North than Albany, NY 61. I have visited our nation's capital only once 62. I was on the yearbook staff during high school and college 63. When my sister and I shared a room as kids, we would talk in our sleep to each other 64. I still talk in my sleep 65. I have driven a tractor 66. I have never been in a wedding - except for my own 67. When I was younger, my cousins and I used to sneak beer and cigars out of our family reunions to drink/smoke after our parents went to bed 68. I used to hate chocolate - used to, but I don't anymore 69. On Average, I drink 3 cups of coffee a day 70. I love to go canoeing and camping 71. I HATE Valentine's Day 72. I cuss like a sailor 73. I fear needles 74. I was 22 years old before I flew in an airplane 75. I used to watch wrestling, but I'm currently taking a break until it gets interesting again 76. My former jobs: day care worker, retail sales clerk, waitress, bartender, hostess, secretary, administrative assistant 77. I have a total of 3 nephews and 3 nieces 78. When I die, I want to have a New Orleans style funeral complete with a band 79. I can clearly remember the day our house burned down when I was in 2nd grade 80. I can't go to sleep without my Chapstick 81. I am still waiting to go on my honeymoon - 1 1/2 years later 82. I have been on a trail ride (horses) 83. The first strapless dress I ever wore was my wedding dress 84. I do not know how to dive 85. It bothers me to not be able to see my feet when I'm in a large body of water 86. I collect fleur-de-lis 87. I am not a fan of chili with beans 88. I don't understand how women can wear pads instead of tampons 89. I despise pastel colors 90. I took 2 years of Spanish in high school and know very, very little of the language 91. I sew even less than my husband does 92. When I accompanied my sister to the doctor for my nephew's shots, I cried more than he did 93. My favorite meal is roast, rice & gravy 94. I was 24 before I had ever colored/highlighted my hair 95. I took self defense and ballroom dancing as electives in college 96. My favorite characters from the 80s are She-Ra the Princess of Power, Rainbow Brite and Strawberry Shortcake 97. Growing up, I hated Barbie because she was too complicated with all of her accessories 98. The 'earbud' earphones are too big for my ears, so they keep popping out - and they hurt 99. I can spray Berg with the water bottle using my left hand from across the room in the middle of the night in the dark and hit him square between the eyes 100. Instead of road rage, I get subway rage when people bump into me without saying excuse me         ",4880,1000,things you probably didn't know about me I am married to my first love I am of girls I am the runt of my family but considered tall in Chris's family I live in Queens in NYC I have a cat named Berg who is evil I work on the th floor of my building here in Rockefeller Plaza I look out onto St Patrick's Cathedral every day I once held down jobs at one time One year I turned in W-2s for my taxes and I felt a little bit like a loser I hate to stand in front of a crowd and talk or give a speech I have weighed the same since I can't remember when I am a morning person I would love to travel and see the world but not have to pay for it all I was arrested when I was I once taught Catechism class as part of my community service see I didn't get my driver's license until I was My first car was an Nissan Sentra that wouldn't start if it was too hot or too cold outside I once wanted to be a lawyer until I found out how much school was required I get to work an hour early every day Most days I eat an everything bagel with cream cheese On weekends I don't eat breakfast until early afternoon The wildest thing I've ever done is move to NYC years ago For my rd birthday Chris got me a tattoo fleur-de-lis in small of my back I've broken my right arm twice The second time I broke my right arm was within weeks after I got it out of the cast from the first time I broke it I've broken my left arm once during a game of dodge ball in th grade In st grade I had to have stitches in my head after a game of dodge ball I consider dodge ball to be a dangerous sport My very first boyfriend was Clay Loftin in the st grade in Martin Coushatta La Clay's mom was my st grade teacher On my wedding day I had to use duct tape to squeeze into my dress because I was bloated Some of my nicknames Heavy D Uncle Bill smokie yaya I once fell off a horse onto my left side and now all of the joints on the left side of my body hurt according to the weather Most days I feel old Chris makes me feel like a princess I don't like lap cats which is why Berg is evil If I could I would go barefoot everywhere I have never been on a diet I don't like mayonnaise peanut butter white or creamy salad dressings most mustards and I'm not very fond of ice cream I lived in Texas for less than a year I've never been snow skiing If I could choose to live anywhere I would choose somewhere in South Louisiana I wish I played either the piano or guitar I've always wanted to be inches taller than I am now When I was a kid I used to sleep walk I hate cold weather I sleep on my stomach I've walked home from work only twice Sept and August blackout On I had only lived here for months and didn't know how to get home so once I got to Queens I followed the subway line which runs above ground I now know that it takes an hour and a half to walk home from Rockefeller Plaza Flip flops are my favorite shoes When I was a kid my favorite shoes were jellies I used to work at a daycare when I was a senior in high school For extra money in high school I used to help my sister cousin and my dad mow the church grounds which included the grave yard I'm terrible at navigating footstones in a grave yard on a riding mower I've held an alligator only once I've petted a shark at the Aquarium of the Americas in New Orleans I have never traveled outside of the United States I've never been further West than Dallas Houston I've never been further North than Albany NY I have visited our nation's capital only once I was on the yearbook staff during high school and college When my sister and I shared a room as kids we would talk in our sleep to each other I still talk in my sleep I have driven a tractor I have never been in a wedding except for my own When I was younger my cousins and I used to sneak beer and cigars out of our family reunions to drink/smoke after our parents went to bed I used to hate chocolate used to but I don't anymore On Average I drink cups of coffee a day I love to go canoeing and camping I HATE Valentine's Day I cuss like a sailor I fear needles I was years old before I flew in an airplane I used to watch wrestling but I'm currently taking a break until it gets interesting again My former jobs day care worker retail sales clerk waitress bartender hostess secretary administrative assistant I have a total of nephews and nieces When I die I want to have a New Orleans style funeral complete with a band I can clearly remember the day our house burned down when I was in nd grade I can't go to sleep without my Chapstick I am still waiting to go on my honeymoon years later I have been on a trail ride horses The first strapless dress I ever wore was my wedding dress I do not know how to dive It bothers me to not be able to see my feet when I'm in a large body of water I collect fleur-de-lis I am not a fan of chili with beans I don't understand how women can wear pads instead of,101,test
386,386,2186817,1,36,"            LONELINESS IS NOT WRITING ENOUGH   It was icy and cold this morning.  Jeffifer had hoped that it might snow or sleet so that we wouldn’t have to work today.  However, the gods dealt a meteorological snake eyes instead.  I arrived at work and waited for Robert.  We were starting the big program today.  He arrived after the time we were supposed to start, but he had a lot of good leads that had occurred over the weekend and we followed up on them.  Robert gave me direction and I responded in a different way.  Instead of feeling like I was being ordered, I approached it more from the viewpoint of helping Robert out.    At lunch time I took off alone to run errands.  In reality, I just wanted to take some time to be by myself and read Julia Cameron’s The Right To Write.  She writes about different areas of writing and then there is a short writing exercise at the end of each chapter.  I’ve been working on this book for over a year.  (Can you say resistance?)  Julia says that when she feels lonely it is because she did not write enough the day before.  At first, this seemed a bit daft for me to accept.  It’s like saying that your anus closed up because you didn’t spin around three times counter-clockwise before you left the house this morning.  However, she went on to elaborate that when we don’t write enough, we have stopped the divine expression through us and we are not letting our true nature out.  The loneliness stems from this phenomena.  Ironically, I cannot remember the last time I was lonely and I know I’m not writing enough.  After lunch, I received a call from J.H.’s office from a new client.  I pre-qualified him for a loan and called him back for some additional information.  It’s really neat to be able to do some great things for people.  Carol Lynn, the Big Kahuna, told us that we are not charging enough for our services and we need to begin to realize that we provide a valuable service.  We replied that we are just starting out and struggling to get deals.  Being the wise woman she is, she reminded us that the deals are starting to come in more frequently and we should adjust our pricing accordingly.  “Just because you charge what you’re worth doesn’t mean your ripping the customer off.”  She is right, of course.    As I drove to the gym tonight, it occurred to me that a lot of my creative visualization has paid off.  It’s amazing how repeating affirmations, or a writing an ideal scene of how I would like my life to be or making a visual treasure map of what I want to manifest and focusing on it for a few minutes a day can actually produce results.  I will say that none of it happened overnight and some things happened in surprising ways that were different from what I had anticipated, yet the essence of what I wanted to achieve was essentially the same.  We’re going to submit four loans this week and after doing okay financially for the past eight months, I believe that I’m actually going to start seeing some good money come in.  I can’t wait to pay off my student loans and be completely debt free.  I’m very lucky that they are the only liabilities I have.  I’d also like to buy a professional quality digital SLR.  I’ve quite playing with my camera because I just don’t have the patience for developing film.  2F’s told me that I should go to bed by midnight.  I don’t like sleeping.  It is such a waste of time.  I’d prefer to be much more productive.  I’m really not that fond of eating either.  It would be so much easier if you could just take a pill for each meal and be done with it.  I wouldn’t have to cook or wash dishes or go to the grocery store.  What a wonderful world it would be!  2F’s and I had a conversation about how odd it is that I’m such a creative person, yet I don’t remember my own dreams.  He told me that with discipline and patience, I too, can remember my dreams.  I told him I knew about this, but it seemed of little value.  I haven’t dreamed about sex or flying in years.  The few dreams I remembered usually involved tedious tasks like organizing the spice rack at the white house or hand washing Madonna’s lingerie.  Why bother?  My sister called me tonight to thank me for calling and wishing her a happy birthday via my mom who was babysitting my niece at the time.  Evidently my niece would not quite playing games until both she and my mother were on the brink of starvation and my father had to come to the rescue with What-A-Burgers.  After the feast, he fell asleep next to the gas fireplace and snored.  My niece wanted juice so my sister told her to have some Hi-C.  My niece argued that it was not juice.  I had to agree with her.  In middle school and high school, we were not allowed to have soft drinks.  We could only buy these gross Hi-C drinks in a can that were ironically manufactured by Coca-Cola.  Considering that juice is basically just sugar, is there any nutritional difference between genetically altered juices and soft drinks?  Speaking of sodas, I told my sister about 2F’s obsession with my soft drink consumption.  It started about a year ago, but every time I pop a can open, he stares at me like I’ve broken into a parked car to steal a radio to sell for crack.  I have explained to him that I typically only drink a Diet Coke at lunch and dinner.  I drink 64 ounces of water around those times, but you would still think I am unable to go to the kitchen without an AA sponsor.  Oddly enough, I have found myself sometimes pouring a Diet Coke and then quickly taking the can to the recycling bin outside to erase any trace of my carbonated pleasure.  Yes, it sounds pathetic, but some days, I just don’t want to see the look.  By the way, things are going well on the South Beach Diet.  Surprisingly, I’m not craving processed foods at all.  I’ve been going to the gym regularly for the past two weeks and I no longer feel any soreness.  I can feel the workout in my muscles tonight.  My pectorals seem to be responding more quickly than normal, but my biceps and triceps just continue to taunt me.  Yes, they become toned, but never seem to grow in size.  I now know the pain of flat-chested women everywhere.  I finished Sex Toys Of The Gods last night.  I liked the ending.  I did not like Tricia, the anal-retentive agent’s assistant, at the beginning, but by the end of the book, I admired her plucky spirit.

387,387,2186817,1,36,"            'CERAMICS ARE DA BOMB!'   Continuing with my song title theme, today's header came from a Chris Isaak EP.  I like Chris.  He's got a great voice, a sense of humor and he's easy on the eyes.  I can even forgive him for  Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me .  I have a German compilation of his hits entitled Wicked Game.  I like it a lot.  I also like this song he sang on  Forever Blue  called  Graduation Day .  I like his old stuff a lot.  I'd like to own all of his CD's one day.  Thinking about Chris Isaak reminds of my friend, Summer.  She's an artist and was one of my instructors while I was in art school.  I learned more from her class than any other.  Afterwards, we would hang over Sunday lunches and have long conversations about all sorts of things.  We talked about music and I introduced her to Kylie's Impossible Princess album.  She painted a piece specifically for my house, which now hangs above my fire place in the living room.  You can check out her work at her  urlLink Web site .  Today was surreal.  It just seemed to float by.  Robert had another anxiety attack this morning.  I went into the office and had my meeting and then went to lunch with Karen.  The assistant pastor at her church resigned.  She didn't know why, but sent me an e-mail later with more information.  I don't know all the facts, but it has something to do with explicit images of him in sexual positions.  I sent a note back to Karen asking for clarification.  It sounds like he posed for a sex manual or an artist.    When Robert had not showed up by lunch time, I drove to his house.  We had a long talk.  We have some clients that are difficult to do anything with.  We finally found a solution for one and we're waiting on some documentation.  One will not provide any documentation.  Another one doesn't have enough money to do anything based upon her credit.  He just let it get to him.  He told me we didn't have any systems in place so I told him to write down what he felt we needed to do, when it needed to happen and who needed to do it.  We have a breakfast meeting with one of our realtors tomorrow.  I'm affirming that it will be the start of a successful and lucrative partnership.  Bonnie came in and shared some disturbing news to me.  She asked if I had known about this information and I admitted that I did not.  In fact, I questioned if the person involved had any idea of the news she shared with me.  I suppose they will talk.  I was reading an article on the BBC Web site about a toaster that does weather forecasts (see Eric's entry on his blog) and there was a link about a new aids vaccine.  It stated that 3/4 of gay and bisexual men had no idea that they were infected with HIV.  That number seems high to me, but it made me think of my conversation with Bonnie.  I came home and washed dishes and picked up around the house a bit.  I decided to spend some quality time with Buddy and jumped on the bed.  The new mattress and box spring is really comfortable.  I can see why 'Princess' spends most of her time on it.  We were enjoying each other's company as I read Rebecca Blood's  The Weblog Handbook .  I bought this book over a year ago and have been trying to finish it.  It's become more interesting to read now that I have put a blog up.  She writes about how our writing styles change and evolve as we continue with our weblog.  I'm sure if I look back over my blog archives, I can see how my personality has developed online.  I wonder if I have shared too much personal information.  She states that there are three reasons why we keep weblogs: information sharing; reputation building; and personal expression.  She has an impressive weblog entitled   urlLink  Rebecca's Pocket   .  2F's came home after a hard days work.  I knew it had been a tough day.  He drank a Coca-Cola.  He changed clothes and then crawled onto the other side of the bed and took a nap as I read.  A few minutes later, I fell asleep as well.  We went over to Elaine's to pick up some books she's giving 2F's for his used book store.  Her cat sat on my coat and made my nose run.  2F's was concerned that I would bring some deadly cat virus home to Buddy and insisted that I wash my hands as soon as I stepped inside the house.  We had some chicken noodle soup and a grilled cheese for dinner.  I received an offer from GLBT (Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgendered) book club.  There are a lot of interesting gay writers out there these days.  I'm interested in reading the one about the man who wrote the  Star Trek  episode entitled  The Trouble With Tribbles .  He adopted a boy who believed he was a Martian.  In other words, plots have moved beyond getting off, coming out, suicide, aids, etc.  Now we have interesting stories about characters that happen to be GLBT and the details of their individual worlds.  I felt drowsy this afternoon.  My nap was enjoyable, but out of the ordinary.  I had plenty of sleep last night.  Perhaps there is something in the air and that contributed to my runny nose and watery eyes.  With the mercurial weather we have in the South, it tends to allow one to become sick with the switches from hot to cold.  I listened to  urlLink Sarah Brightman 's  Fly  album.  I think it was repackaged as  Time To Say Goodbye  in the U.S.  I admit that the cover art presents a different expectation for the listener.  It's an underrated album.  I worked a bit on a design for my personal Web site.  I'm also thinking of moving my blog to another domain so that I can do a bit more with it.  When we are at Elaine's house tonight, she was watching  CSI .  One of the stories was about a couple that killed their baby by leaving him in the car in the garage on a hot summer's day.  They gave the baby cough syrup to help him along.  They thought that he had some rare disease that their first born had died from in a slow, agonizing process.  Come to find out, the symptoms the second baby had were due to small quantities of pesticide that came from the mother.  I believe she was a professional gardener.  The baby was perfectly fine.  For some reason that really just stayed with me.  Ironically, the father was played by the actor in  Big Eden , which is a movie I mentioned in yesterday's blog.  Hmmm, say....

397,397,2186817,1,36,"            LOST IN TRANSLATION   We went to dinner tonight at Murphy’s in Virginia Highlands and planned to see  Lost In Translation  afterwards.  I was frustrated with 2F’s because I told him we needed to be at the restaurant by 7pm and he didn’t get into the shower until 6:45pm.  He acted as if it was no big deal to keep Donald & Julie waiting.  If the shoe was on the other foot, I would receive a judgmental diatribe that I would have to end abruptly with two choice words.    Parking is always a challenge in the Highlands so we parked about four blocks away.  I was still feeling angry on the inside, but trying to be friendly on the outside.  2F’s was oblivious.  We were inside the restaurant and 2F’s tells me to go check our reservations.  Julie had called and made a reservation for four under my last name and I had called and made a reservation for four under my first name.  Clearing this mix up was almost lost in translation, but finally resolved.  Someone tapped me on the shoulder.  It was Troy from our neighborhood.  I was still struggling with my inner rage and was trying to be friendly.  His partner, Todd, came in and said hello and walked off.  We had all gone to the movies almost a year ago and had a really great time.  In fact, I was looking forward to getting to know them better.  I ran into them at a restaurant once and said hello and they just walked on by.  Granted, I don’t know what was going on inside them at the time, but I at least make the effort of being friendly.    There is a line from the movie where Bill Murray’s character describes what it’s like to grow older.  You begin to realize what you want and you don’t care what other people think.  I’m tired of dealing with the bi-polar swings of other people.  From now on I think I will just do and say exactly what I think.  What’s wrong with letting people know you feel pissed on the inside at the moment?  It’s how I feel.  I want to people to see my dark, immature, dangerous side as well as the loving, devil-may-care, laid back side.  It’s real.  It’s sexy.  It’s me.  I related to Scarlett Johansen’s character the most.  So much of my life I have felt like a stranger in a strange land.  I’ve wanted to reach out and connect with other people without knowing quite how.  Sometimes I have stumbled and done it badly.  Other times I have done so quite eloquently and still did not achieve the imagined result.  In the earlier part of my life, I had wanted a boyfriend so badly.  I never could find the right fit.  Now I have the perfect boyfriend, but I’ve realized that perhaps what I was searching for was more of a kindred spirit than a partner.    Kent was my best friend growing up.  I had known him since I was 13.  We could have fun doing anything.  We could complete each other’s sentences and others often thought we were lovers, which we were not.  We communicated on so many different levels besides words.  We understood one another… and I’ve never really experienced that again.  I miss having a best friend.  I miss Kent.  I wish that night had never happened and I wish he had never bought that gun.  Scarlett Johanson favors Jeff’s wife, Kim.  When they visited us last summer, Kim and I connected on a very cool level.  The kids went to sleep early and all the Jef(f)s and Kim would sit around at night waxing on about things serious and not so serious.  One night, the boys went out by themselves and it was just Kim and I and we talked until we fell asleep.  It was so exciting.  It was like coming home, but yet I found myself holding back because I knew I needed to protect myself.  I knew as soon as they left, the magic would be gone and we would not be able to maintain the connection.  It was better to nip that euphoria in the bud so I would not be disappointed later.  Expectation is the child of the ego and almost uncontrollable.  It dances with disappointment on a regular basis.  I find I’m much happier if I don’t put expectations on other people.  Perhaps one day if I ever visit Jeff & Kim in Canada, Kim and I will expand upon that connection.  Then again, maybe not.  It will most likely be somewhat different because we will both be different people.  Will it be worse?  Will it be better?  Why not just let it be what it is?  I’ll take door number three, Bob!  We had a great time tonight with Donald and Julie.  They are absolutely two of my favorite people in the world.  We always have the most interesting conversations.  There is still a lot that I don’t know about them, but they seem like the kind of people who prefer to reveal their different layers in time.  I respect that.  Ironically, I have always been someone who wants to know everything about my friends immediately.  Perhaps that is why they came into my life; I have been gifted with the mystery of patience.  2F’s reached out and took my hand during the movie.  I like holding hands.  He has big hands, but they are soft and comforting.  They always make me feel that everything will be alright.  Today while hanging up laundry I found a magnetic dart board set that I bought for myself at Restoration while Christmas shopping.  I had always wanted a dart board ever since I read that Keren Woodward from Bananarama has one in her kitchen.  I opened it for the first time and looked at it.  I smiled to myself and thought, “I never have time to play games.”  Correction: I never make time to play games.  Rebecca Blood stated that one of the reasons people keep a weblog is for self-expression, and in doing so, they gain greater clarity in their thinking.  I believe she is right.  One thing that I have realized over the past few months is that this blog is for me… and not anyone else.          ",5212,1000,LOST IN TRANSLATION We went to dinner tonight at Murphy’s in Virginia Highlands and planned to see Lost In Translation afterwards I was frustrated with F’s because I told him we needed to be at the restaurant by pm and he didn’t get into the shower until pm He acted as if it was no big deal to keep Donald Julie waiting If the shoe was on the other foot I would receive a judgmental diatribe that I would have to end abruptly with two choice words Parking is always a challenge in the Highlands so we parked about four blocks away I was still feeling angry on the inside but trying to be friendly on the outside F’s was oblivious We were inside the restaurant and F’s tells me to go check our reservations Julie had called and made a reservation for four under my last name and I had called and made a reservation for four under my first name Clearing this mix up was almost lost in translation but finally resolved Someone tapped me on the shoulder It was Troy from our neighborhood I was still struggling with my inner rage and was trying to be friendly His partner Todd came in and said hello and walked off We had all gone to the movies almost a year ago and had a really great time In fact I was looking forward to getting to know them better I ran into them at a restaurant once and said hello and they just walked on by Granted I don’t know what was going on inside them at the time but I at least make the effort of being friendly There is a line from the movie where Bill Murray’s character describes what it’s like to grow older You begin to realize what you want and you don’t care what other people think I’m tired of dealing with the bi-polar swings of other people From now on I think I will just do and say exactly what I think What’s wrong with

404,404,2587254,1,15,"              3/20/04   Spiritual Hat Trick By Christ himself   OK.....well after TC 2004....you know....especially this year as I had mentioned before I feel re-dedicated and refreshed. God already showed me so much this week. I'll basically go straight into the whole 'Spiritual Hat-Trick' in a moment.....but today was just so spiritually amazing. No wait....correction that this WEEK has just been.....so powerful. I was gonna say weird but earlier when I was talkin' to my dad he used the word 'powerful,' which I find MUCH more appropriate.  Well today sadly was the day I head back to London. *sigh* TC 2004, the chillin' in downtown T-dot, yeah it's all gonna be cherished for a while hehehe. I mean......just havin' bot hthe priviledges of Spiritual growth....and just havin a blast w/ some friends......yeah it's honestly some of the best times that I think you can have on this earth. So yeah.....we said our final good-byes and stuff, and headed out the door for our final subway ride down to Union Station for home. This morning I was really missin' TC lol.  Well before headin' out the door.....logged on MSN for a bit and checked my blog's g-bookie. It's CRAZY how small this world is. Apparently the counselor that helped me re-dedicate......is none other than Gerty's Cousin! Waaaaah.........Daniel Trinh and Gerty are related!? NOOOOOOO WAY! And then also....I found out that Jesse Wong apparently knows one of Jenn's friends. And then she told me that Jesse's girlfriend goes to TCBC. Wow what a small world just thinkin' about it now. My old HYPE counselor somehow knows Jenn lol. Er Jenn's friend. And Gerty's cousin helped me get my life back on track? Incredible. So cool though =P.  But yeah....got a drive from Dave's parents to the Subway stop.....and then said our Thank-You's and stuff and then headed downstairs. Stupid Toronto subway. I thought I got stuck in the revolving doors. I was going through VERY slowly through the door w/ my gargantuan bag when I hear a *click* and I'm thinkin 'There's no friggin way your lockin' on my ya piece of crap.' Thankfully it was a false alarm lol, but yeah it was pretty scary at the moment=P. But yeah then we headed to the train stop.....found Jason *we were a bit late but we lived* then quickly ran to the train. JUST MADE IT FOR BOARDING. Too bad all the group seats are taken *blast* but we managed to find some aisle seats near one another. However though this would lead me to a really weird thought later on...  Well as the train started headin' off, I started listenin' to music. Jason was already slowly dozin', Gavin was readin his TC booklet, and Josh I'm not sure of because he sat in front of me. I know though he did his devos because I saw him do his when I started doing mine. I haven't been using the ODB actually for a bit, and I'm actually gonna probably begin using the Purpose Driven Life devo book for the next well......40 days hehe. But today I just read Matthew 6, and just read over how to pray once again. To me honestly, prayer is probably like THE biggest thing. Just the idea of putting total faith on the Heavenly Father.....yeah that's why I think prayer is one of the most powerful things out of all the things to do for a Christian. So yeah I am finding the Lectio Divina method of doing devos pretty effective. i'm really startin' to sometimes really be able to just PICTURE the exact happenings of the stuff written in the Good Book. So did my Devos in about 40 minutes....yeah I find long time devotions really is effective. I did it last night too....read Acts chapter two about when the Apostles started to talk in different languages all of a sudden after being filled with the Holy Spirit. So yeah I guess TC did effect me a hefty bit this year. I just hope that it lasts on until....well.....ever hehe. Well yeah just finished devos and......PERFECT TIMING! Lunch =P.  Mmm.....Ham and Cheese sandwich. The marvelous talent of VIA cooks =P. Gavin payed for my meal since he owed me $$$. So his 7 dollar debts been paid.....and Josh still owes me 2.50 hehe. David still owes me 15 bucks from bus tickets lol. So yeah it was a pretty good lunch. Gave my peanuts to some dude sitting beside me. Pretty cool guy though. We chatted a bit about few things. UT2K4, gaming, even a bit about religion. Was kinda interesting to see him having a Muslim Qo-Ran. So I asked him if he was Muslim. Apparently he's Catholic....just readin Qo-Ran for more knowledge. Kinda intersting though....I sorta wanna get to know other religions better though too. So after that I then started to listen to my music for.......hmm.....30 minutes or so. Oh yeah really weird....I think I saw my careers teacher in the train too =S.   Actually one thing that kinda got me thinkin' on the train today was my devo. See....there's always people saying how the Bible's 'contradictory' but honestly I have never seen it happen before. Well today I ALMOST thought that with the line 'don't pray like the Gentiles do.' Thing is though...I am a Gentile. I'm a non-Jewish Christian. However....as I kept thinking about it....it did make sense in the end. I mean....it's sorta like how if you read something saying something like 'don't program this program like the humans did.' However, you're a human being. A Person. But, you can still change your way from how the previous humans programmed.  It's like how I'm a Gentile Christian.....but I don't do what the Gentiles do in Prayer. Get it?  Well after chattin' for a bit n' stuff, FINALLY LONDON ONTARIO. Blast. I was actually kinda sad too because now I'm officially 200 kilometres from Toronto. Crappage. Well got a ride from Gavin's parents......and off to home I went.  Home.....basically I sat in front of the comp chattin' to TC kids, reorganizing comp, and just lookin at the 97+ pics I took while on vacation hehehe. Wonder how I'm gonna get these developed lol. So talked to TC kids, and then this was where the Spiritual Hat-Trick came in.  I used the term 'Hat-Trick' as first I'm a hockey fan and I felt God has majorly showed me three amazing things this last week. First one: gotta be the craaaazy dedication that I saw my counselor Sumair have from being a 'sorta' Muslim guy to a devoted Christian. I was wowed by how he became one. He had to just go through so much toil, and arguments at times to get to his goal. But I really praise the Lord for lettin' him receive the prize. So yeah that was the one big first thing that hit me. So that's One 'Goal.'  The second feat that God showed me of himself was the WHOLE TC 2004 day two. First thing that was when I re-dedicated myself to God....and I was just almost in tears in seeing so many people either re-dedicating or dedicating for the first time. Really felt a warm feeling in my heart. And also just the final worship......when I prayed for most of it....and just reflected.....wow so much happened there. I doubt I'll be able to describe it in blog....but it was just sometin' that I never felt before. I mean....I just felt the Holy Spirit just take over me and seem to say 'Welcome back Joe into God's arms.'  And also after Gavin's talk today about how he felt demons and stuff during worship.....real deep stuff but really makes me think twice about why I'm so priviledged to know Christ. It's also crazy how Gavin felt it during worship....just shows how powerful Satan's presence can be....yet be defeated by Words of God when Gavin prayed for it to leave. So yeah that was Goal #2.  Now the 3rd one. This one is a bit weird. I mean it started off with a debate w/ Josh on whether d/l music is cool or not. Now personally up until now I still don't consider it 'stealing' but he did. So we kinda got into an argument *details not included* and then in the end I kinda ended with a 'Alrite I'll stop d/l music if either God or the Artist tells me to stop.' Well....this sentence I think kinda cornered me as God would show me at fellowship. See today we had a workshop on 'descision making' and how the four main things that affect it are:  Values Virtues Variables Vision  So yeah.....I was thinkin' 'wow....these things are basically the things I was goin' through my head when I was debating with Josh.' Now though.......I don't know for sure if God's tellin' me to stop d/l music though....cuz I mean....I'm not exactly selling it for myself, I'm just d/l em for my own musical appreciation.I guess I kinda live by the sense that music is like art. Josh actually came up with this analogy. Art if you like it can be sketched for appreciation. So basically well I basically just download the music for appreciation. So up until now....I'm still a bit confused, but as the night is going by *it's 1am now* I think I'm starting to get a clearer vision of this. I mean.....I guess I've been livin' by the whole idea of 'private use is OK' sorta thing. But I think I'll be buyin' CD's soon anyways. But yeah......I guess it just made me think today....'God REALLY does speak when you challenge him.' So yeah.......think I'm gonna be thinkin' twice before I type now. Just how direct and how quickly The Lord answered me....wow. Thanks for the eye-opener God.  Well.......actually come to think of it Christ scored more than 3 goals this week. There was also the very strange thing of how my workshop got switched.......but it was switched for the best. Originally I was gonna take a workshop on relationships and another on Music and Evangelism....but in the end the Music one got cut off....which left me with none other than.....'Give me Oil in my Lamp.' This workshop was for the best though. I now really know what 'doing my devos' really means....er wait what was the other word I used before....socializing w/ Christ? That works hehe. So yeah and also....I am now beginning to fix up my prayer. In fact I tried it out today.....and I was amazed how fluent my prayer went. It was as though the Holy Spirit was actually in me.....speaking out of me word for word. So yeah.......put it this way forget the hat-trick thing. What's someone who's scored more than 12 goals in one game called =P.  As for the rest of fellowship tonight......well after the little Missions Presentation we got from a group of missionaries, HYPE had their own little meeting about TC. Junior one really seems watered down from the previous ones. I guess removing the workshops really had sometin' to do with it. But yeah Steph seemed to have a cool week back in London too w/ her dad. And then the seniors (me, Gavin, Josh, Brian and Jason) had LOTS to say. So yeah we took up about an hour. Talked about so much. I mean just some things I remember off the top of my head.....  Well Josh talked about the vision of heaven that he had a while ago. Thing is though this time he was tellin' us about how he afterwards prayed for each of us to either experience or envision God in another way. Surprisingly without me knowing......it happened. That dream I told you about a while ago about my church growing? Well...see these were all never on our prayer request lists......yet we somehow seemed to mentally communicate. And Gavin............he's really been experiencing so much. That little dude can take in a hefty bit of stuff in a few days. I mean....if his seeing the Spiritual Realm gift is true......wow he's got lots of courage to use it. So yeah today I've been stunned, confused, amazed, and just recognizing God's power all at once. So much has happened.....I think that tomorrow morning *Sunday* is one Sunday that I truly need to clear up my mind. I mean today in fellowship I wrote so much.....my booklet I got from TC looks like a collage of graphite. We talked alot also just about how TC seemed to connect us back to our HYPE lessons too (Spiritual Gifts one mainly) and how it's affected us. This is actually pretty cool how these last few days seem to go so well......it's like the total opposite of my windmills=P. Oh yeah also....Josh talked about his little talk w/ Lily about religion. Well apparently that has now spurred Josh into tryin' to look into Buddhism and see what makes them tick. I just hope that Josh knows where he's goin.....same w/ Gavin and his Spiritual Gift.  From all this thoughI'm really startin' to have a new look on pre-destination. I don't know why....but all this seems to have been set up perfectly. It's like putting a sports play into action and working 100% smoothly. I mean Workshop change, the message Pastor Kirk gave, Josh's prayers.....too good to be random. So yeah...these few days.....I really have had lots of reflecting time. And I'm thankful I had the  time....just so much to think about.  Well after the long discussion......got some forms n' stuff for gym nite....and then went into groups for prayer. Me, Gavin and Carmen got put together into one group. I actually liked it though. I mean the talk we had.....about Spiritually preparing for battle and how to be careful of using our gifts....really cool stuff. But yeah just hope they are careful with it and use it with the right aim. So yeah this was when I prayed.....the most fluent prayer......I had ever heard myself speak. So yeah....this was a great note to end on from the whole week.  So yeah.....I gotta be headin' to bed. Lol me and Karen have been postin' pics up on Martha MSN Group (http://groups.msn.com/m-a-r-t-h-a) so yeah I've been kept busy for a while hehe. Well I'm out for the night. But just thinkin' back on all the stuff that's happened......I mean TC 2004, the talk at fellowship, and the somewhat ongoing debate in my mind about d/l music. Still though I think I'll still be d/l music....but honestly not as frequent. Also I may start to be buyin' some WOW Worship CD's. But yeah....this week has just been awesome. I'll be bloggin' more tomorrow....since I'm gonna be a bit of a hermit doing all my h/w hehehehe. So yeah I'm out kids. Later.         ",5557,1000,Spiritual Hat Trick By Christ himself OK.....well after TC you know....especially this year as I had mentioned before I feel re-dedicated and refreshed God already showed me so much this

412,412,2587254,1,15,"              1/22/04   GOUNG HEI FAT CHOI TO ALL......and I got a history exam   Wow.....time really flies. I can still rememer the first day back from summer holidays when I first walked into history class and thought.....wow this is gonna be one slow year. Turns out I'm wrong. Now it's already January 22nd......2004. Chinese New Year was today....that's what the greeting was for in my subtitle. But this year I hope will be a prosperous year. So far I've been having a good year academically. Trying to stay above the 80 mark. So far its paying off. Today I found out I ended with a 92% on my careers project....my mark is gonna be at least a 82. Usually my mark estimates are decent. So the action packed exam week is starting tomorrow. Whoo hoo. First up to the plate.....History. Dreaded history. Though it's my highest mark...I hate exams. I really think I won't do that amazing on it. I forgot lots of the crap we've learned. But that's ok.......with the mark I have in history....i'm unstoppable....sorta. Today was pretty exciting though in ways....tried new ps2 game, got good final project mark in careers, and surfed the net in programming. And of course went to Jason's house to study history w/ Hammond and him.....Here's the detailed summary....you have to scroll down a bit......  Once again.......RELUCTANT TO LEAVE BED! UGH especially with my sleeping times.... tonight I really gotta sleep early for exam tomorrow. Well I woke up around 730....trudged downstairs to see a bowl of oatmeal staring at my bloodshot eyed face......well ate it......then quickly washed my hair to get bedhead out....changed.....grabbed school crap *and Jason's controller and NFSU for his house after school* and bolted out the door.  Weird.....today Patrick's mom and dad drove us to school. I guess his mom was going somewhere. Looked like skiing. But yeah traffic was horrible today. Oxford was gridlocked from Talbot intersection all the way to wonderland intersection. Well eventually we would make it out and I barely made it into class on time. But yes I made it. Wow so exciting there.......the action of running up 3 flights of stairs to history...I should have a theme song and a stunt double for this sort of action...  History we basically just did review.....I feel a lot more relaxed now about tomorrow's exam. Not as tensed up as before. Also I don't have to worry because we got updated marks again. My mark is still above 90 so I don't really care. Weird though today. People sitting in front of me were trying to name all 50 states in USA. I was thinking how boring history could get....I mean naming 50 states? Isn't that worse? I tried to name a few in my head.....got to like 45. Well yeah announcements came on and off to careers....  WHOO! Careers we finally finished movie 'Finding Forrester.' It was actually a really good movie. Very meaningful. And I think that my prayer requests and prayers really did pay off.....92% on my careers project. This is a big jump from 72% mark in November. I'm happy w/ my mark. Me and Hammond ended up studying for chem exam next wednesday. Then Hammond started to threaten me with a blue Sharpie. Whoot i got hit. Now lunchtime.....  Ended up going to McD's w/ Thompson and the others. Apparently Nathan heard about the pushing into snowbanks from the other day.....Mike got a bite back in the ass from when he pushed Thompson yesterday...Thompson rocked him today lol. Then at McD's we started throwing our cheeseburger wrappers *we had A LOT of cheeseburgers* and then we almost got kicked out.....stupid customer satisfaction. Then Thompson made a bet w/ me and nate that he could hit Maisie sitting at the other table. Damn. It grazed her lol NOT HIT but grazed. So therefore we don't owe him anything =P. So yeah after that little wrapper war we started walking back to school......with attempts to snowbank nate. Never worked. He almost got me and Thompson simultaneously. That was pathetic. But yeah we chased him back to school with crap attempts.....and now to math class.....  Math class we didn't do much.....got some h/w and did it.....Thompson was getting hell though. Jessica was drawing on the back of his neck and i got his face w/ a whiteboard eraser. He turned into Justin Rhoden for a sec....you know an Oreo. Well eventually he'd go clean it off, and he'd get me back by hitting chalk brushes in front of me. Bastard. Not much else happened. Thompson tried on glasses.....lol he frickin hilarious. Forgot who I said he looks like but he looked REALLY funny. Anyways after the math......hmm.....oh yeah now programming class....zzZZzzzZzZZzz.....  Programming like usual was w/ Hyperstudio. But since I was done.....I surfed the net for a while. Looked at some blog sites, NHL stats, and of course my fantasy teams that I made. I'm still in 6th place. Stupid Thompson's London Chinese. Ugh. Oh yeah we also got our tests back today finally. Got 73% on one and 80% on the other. Not bad considering half the class failed both. Turing was somewhat challenging but I'm happy that we learned it. Now at least I know the basics of programming. Sorta. Hmm........not much else happened......Day 1's are so boring. I just noticed that. Though I like the subjects better it's actually REALLY boring. Well who cares enough of that time to go to Jason's.....   Well I met Jason at his locker, then we went to mine....got my stuff....then left. I remember Hammond wanted to come study too but Jason apparently wants to get home ASAP. Well eventually Hammond caught up to us and greeted me with a friendly push into the snowbank. Ugh. That's 1.5 today. I ALMOST got pushed in at lunch but instead of falling in i somehow managed to land in the knee high snow on my feet and ran back out of the snowbank. DAMN WAS IT COLD! We eventually made it to Jason's, with my complaining of how a car seems faster. Obviously. But Jason's house is actually pretty far from Central. We got to his house probably around 3:15 and were met by a box of donuts and well......burned Leen Goe. Apparently Jason's dad can make it *he's a chef too* but his mom isn't that great at it.....it looked like 'Crap with Caramel sauce' quoted from Hammond. Well we started off the study session with a game of NFSU, then some NFL street.....but I didn't really play and started studying. Jason was still playing NFL Street when me and Hammond did some studying....then some chatting....eventually Jason would join for  bout 20 minutes.....then started playing again. Hammond left around 5ish and I started to do more intense studying. I actually got some stuff done. Oh yeah Jason's mom gave me and Hammond Lai See. Jason's familiy is actually very generous. I was surprised I got one. I would then give one to Jason too....well my mom would.  But that would be later. Jason would then put on Rush Hour 2 to watch while I studied also.....while he kept working on NFL street.... I would go on his comp for a bit.....then back to studying. Eventually I woulda stueid straight from 5:30-630ish. Then I thought might as well try NFL street though it looked stupid. WOW IS IT FUN! Though it makes no sense compared to real football it's just funny how me and Jason played. I didn't really know how to play so I was horrible @ D but I was decent on offense. Made a few completions and lots of run plays. Lol Jason's not the most amazing QB but the stuff he did was pretty funny. 30 yard dropbacks, 50 yard passes, running when he figured out I can't run routes that well in a football game. Yeah it was pretty funny some of the stuff that happened. I might buy the game. Actually.......naw. Rather buy Silent HIill 3, or Grand Turismo 4 when it comes out. But yeah Jason's house actually is pretty cool place. He has food.  Also it was nice to see that he has his Bible by his bed. I'm assuming he reads it. He was pretty enthusiastic about it when he first got it. Pretty nice Bible though. And it seems to have benefited. He has grown spiritually faster than Dan or Mike. Dunno if it's maturity level or the fact a Bible helps this much....but it's nice to see how fast he's started his walk of faith. It's cool though. And he's taken in this stuff pretty nicely. I mean no offense to Gavin but when he first came to church he REALLY despised it it seemed like. But of course after 5 years he seems to be enjoying the environment. I still think we need a bigger church...and a new building. But that will come in time.....  Well by now after playing a few  round of NFL street my mom came.....so packed up my stuff and went home. Exhausted now......cramming for history tomorrow....and of course practicing music. I really wanna do good in music. Well anyways it's around 1130 now.......and I'm still studying. One big prayer tonight.....God's guidance with my exams....and of course the others. Wonder how they are taking exam week in. Carmen seems to always be stressed out with like daily homework. Josh usually is pretty serious w/ work. Dunno bout Steph or Gavin. Calvin I guess he's pretty relaxed bout this.....like everything else. I'm pretty laid back about exams. Just science I'm worried about. History I'm not worried......just kinda scared I'll just blank out in exam tomorrow. But then again I normally anticipate exams and big tests waay too much than it actually is. I mean math midterms studying for three hours? I think I went overkill. But it paid off. 86%. So I guess though I sacrificed piano.......i did good in school. Well I'm gonna go study a bit more....then get a good night's rest before my horrid exam tomorrow.  To end this entry....Have a few things to say  Sun Leen Fai Lok (Happy New Year) Hok Yeep Juun Bo (Hope your learning is ongoing in new year) Goung Hei Fat Choi (basically means may good fortunes bestow on you in new year)  and of course.....  SUN TAI GEEN HONG (be in good health)  I think that one's important because to me it's telling you......hopefully you stay healthy enough to make next new years =P. Well I'm out. Good luck to everyone on exams. Later.         ",5617,1000,GOUNG HEI FAT CHOI TO ALL......and I got a history exam Wow.....time really flies I can still rememer the first day back from summer holidays when I first walked into history class and thought.....wow this is gonna be one slow year Turns out I'm wrong Now it's already January nd Chinese New Year was today....that's what the greeting was for in my subtitle But this year I hope will be a prosperous year So far I've been having a good year academically Trying to stay above the mark So far its paying off Today I found out I ended with a on my careers project....my mark is gonna be at least a Usually my mark estimates are decent So the action packed exam week is starting tomorrow Whoo hoo First up to the plate.....History Dreaded history Though it's my highest mark...I hate exams I really think I won't do that amazing on it I forgot lots of the crap we've learned But that's ok.......with the mark I have in history....i'm unstoppable....sorta Today was pretty exciting though in ways....tried new ps game got good final project mark in careers and surfed the net in programming And of course went to Jason's house to study history w Hammond and him.....Here's the detailed summary....you have to scroll down a bit Once again.......RELUCTANT TO LEAVE BED UGH especially with my sleeping times tonight I really gotta sleep early for exam tomorrow Well I woke up around trudged downstairs to see a bowl of oatmeal staring at my bloodshot eyed face......well ate it......then quickly washed my hair to get bedhead out....changed.....grabbed school crap and Jason's controller and NFSU for his house after school and bolted out the door Weird.....today Patrick's mom and dad drove us to school I guess his mom was going somewhere Looked like skiing But yeah traffic was horrible today Oxford was gridlocked from Talbot intersection all the way to wonderland intersection Well eventually we would make it out and I barely made it into class on time But yes I made it Wow so exciting there.......the action of running up flights of stairs to history...I should have a theme song and a stunt double for this sort of action History we basically just did review.....I feel a lot more relaxed now about tomorrow's exam Not as tensed up as before Also I don't have to worry because we got updated marks again My mark is still above so I don't really care Weird though today People sitting in front of me were trying to name all states in USA I was thinking how boring history could get....I mean naming states Isn't that worse I tried to name a few in my head.....got to like Well yeah announcements came on and off to careers WHOO Careers we finally finished movie Finding Forrester It was actually a really good movie Very meaningful And I think that my prayer requests and prayers really did pay off on my careers project This is a big jump from mark in November I'm happy w my mark Me and Hammond ended up studying for chem exam next wednesday Then Hammond started to threaten me with a blue Sharpie Whoot i got hit Now lunchtime Ended up going to McD's w Thompson and the others Apparently Nathan heard about the pushing into snowbanks from the other day.....Mike got a bite back in the ass from when he pushed Thompson yesterday...Thompson rocked him today lol Then at McD's we started throwing our cheeseburger wrappers we had A LOT of cheeseburgers and then we almost got kicked out.....stupid customer satisfaction Then Thompson made a bet w me and nate that he could hit Maisie sitting at the other table Damn It grazed her lol NOT HIT but grazed So therefore we don't owe him anything P So yeah after that little wrapper war we started walking back to school......with attempts to snowbank nate Never worked He almost got me and Thompson simultaneously That was pathetic But yeah we chased him back to school with crap attempts.....and now to math class Math class we didn't do much.....got some h/w and did it.....Thompson was getting hell though Jessica was drawing on the back of his neck and i got his face w a whiteboard eraser He turned into Justin Rhoden for a sec....you know an Oreo Well eventually he'd go clean it off and he'd get me back by hitting chalk brushes in front of me Bastard Not much else happened Thompson tried on glasses.....lol he frickin hilarious Forgot who I said he looks like but he looked REALLY funny Anyways after the math......hmm.....oh yeah now programming class....zzZZzzzZzZZzz Programming like usual was w Hyperstudio But since I was done.....I surfed the net for a while Looked at some blog sites NHL stats and of course my fantasy teams that I made I'm still in th place Stupid Thompson's London Chinese Ugh Oh yeah we also got our tests back today finally Got on one and on the other Not bad considering half the class failed both Turing was somewhat challenging but I'm happy that we learned it Now at least I know the basics of programming Sorta Hmm........not much else

415,415,2587254,1,15,"              2/28/04   Blasted Leap year postponing TC...Bah.   It's unfortunate how much difference one day can make. I was at my piano lesson today and when I read the date 'February 28th' I thought SWEET TOMORROW'S MARCH! Wait.........is it a leap year? D'OH! *Ugh* Now I gotta wait an extra 24 hours for TC. It's actually a really exciting time. Other than the fact I can escape this blasted hicktown that I live in.....well a 'city' in Canadian standards, but also just the fact that going to a conference w/ so many other Christians....really is an awesome feeling. But other than that....my Saturday was pretty mellow.......not exciting......or boring........but.....so-so.  Due to piano practice.......I had to wake up earlier than usual. But I had some of THE most peculiar dreams ever. Unfortunately I don't remember the dreams that well now......but I just remember waking up and going.....=S. This is why I should write out an outline for my blog earlier in the day maybe lol. Some thing I want to put in......never get put in. Dreams to me are vital. They do so much in life. If it weren't for dreams we could never imagine the unimaginable. Also they can poise so many questions in life. If I remember correctly....I think it was another dream about our church in the future. Hmm...Deja Vu? or if there's a French term for 'same subject of dreaming twice in a row?' *Shrug* I think that I think just a wee bit too much on that subject. But there's some food for thought on what I think a lot about.....dreams. Maybe I've been influenced by the Joseph in the Bible...the dream interpreter I mean not the one that Mary was married to.....or maybe I just like to think about things like this.  Well after 60 minutes of playing the piano *I ACTUALLY PLAYED MORE THAN 200 MINUTES THIS WEEK!* I had well.....brunch. Snow peas have become a fav food of mine now. I'm not a vegetarian....but I'm a fan of veggies. I'd prefer Chicken Caesar over Steak. Wait scrap that hell no I'll just prefer it over a burger......steak is another story lol. And I realize chicken is a meat. But yeah had some of that w/ some beef......and of course the universal food that goes with anything.....Rice. And some milk instead of tea for once. So yeah after that it was off to piano.....where I'd realize that this year's a leap year *crappage.*  Well a different twist in cars too. Dad took a test drive of the Kia Sorento *mid-size SUV from the imitation Hyundai company.* Actually the car's not horrible. The interior I like a lot.....but I still hate the name brand. It's kinda like how I prefer the Mazda Tribute over the Ford Escape though they are the EXACT same car almost. Different names though =P. But the Kia isn't bad at all. It was actually a decent car. But off to piano now...  Piano was alright. I've decided to do Gr. 8 exam next January. And apparently Mrs. Mitsis has a whole plan to have me conquer Gr. 8 and 9 piano in one year. I would do grade 8 exam in January.......work my ass off until June and then do my Gr. 9 exam in June. Possible? Yes? Great chances of it happening? Maybe. Doing all that and still succeeding in theory and school? That will require some thinking lol. But I'm thinking this could work.....WHO NEEDS GR. 11 MARKS IN SCHOOL =P. Me. Yes Shut up I realize that I need both.  Well when I got home..........I started 'planning' to go to Masonville w/ Caitlin, Rebecca, Sarah, Lindsay, and well.....Hammond. Hammond didn't really help at all though probably caused more chaos than good lol. Well originally it was either movie or just chill @ the mall......but the Hammond added we hang out at his place. So we would spend 30 minutes figuring out which one to do.......then in the end I kinda thought 'Hmm.......it's 2:30.......dun really wanna just go do sometin for an hour and a half and then go home' so I kinda dropped out. But in the end...Sarah couldn't go to the mall anyways since she had to babysit....so it was down to two choices.....Hammond's or Mall. Hmm........then it went to one.....but that was after another 30 minutes. Hammond finally actually asked if we could go to his place and the answer: No. So yeah.....this kinda pissed off a few of us, the fact that we spent an hour deciding over nothing basically. So yeah...in the end only the girls went. Oh yeah and lesson learned from that: When planning w/ Lindsay, Rebecca, Sarah and Caitlin plus Hammond......PLAN 7 DAYS AHEAD!  Well so I stayed on MSn a bit. Made plans to throw around the football on the street w/ Patrick for a bit. But before that......talked to Jenn and Gerty on MSN for a bit. Yeah recalled TC memories......and Jenn convinced Gerty to use Friendster. Lol Jenn seemed to have some competition w/ 'Joe I convinced Gerty to use Friendster you lose!' I didn't realize there was a competition but in that case........Blast I lost. Wow look at that emotion.....*zzZZZzz.* But yeah good times........can't wait to meet up w/ them, Ju and everyone else from TC again this March Break. Wonder if I'll even see em @ TC....I mean 500 people....might be kinda hard to find em......=P. Hmm then again I wonder how many Asians really wear Adidas tracksuits lol. Referring to me by the way you slow shmucks.  And then I went to hang out w/ Patrick. Threw around the football then played some PS2. True Crime can be kinda fun when you're bored lol. We kinda just ran around the city doing random drive-by's, roadkilled some people and imitated the movie 'Speed.' You know the one w/ Keanu Reeves, some chick and they are struggling to keep a bus going so it won't explode? Yeah we imitated that lol.......but failed miserably when we rolled down a hill because apparently.......buses don't have enough horsepower to make it up a hill lol. And I decided to try a Jackie Chan maneuvre by jumping off a freeway.....but kinda got foiled when my dude died hitting the ground. So yeah did that and then went to Wendy's.....then HYPE.   Wendy's not much to say. Well she dyed her hair again......it's red now. She kinda was gettin peeved at me not noticing.....eheheheheheh sorry 'bout that by the way Wendy but yeah.......she kinda got mad at me for that =P. Ehehehehe=D. Well after that........I quickly ate.....waited around for dad and then me and Jason got driven to church.  Tonight we had.....well a spiritual version of Sex Ed. It.........was kinda weird. I guess I'd never think about having a thing like that at a church........but......well.......it kinda 'flowed' along. Well before that...I got the crap scared out of me by Pastor Mackness when I was going down the stairs *Can pastors scare the living daylights out of a church member? lol* and also we had a few exciting games of chess. We butcher the game so bad it's not even funny. Well first game I sorta took over a evened out game between Gavin and Calvin....then kinda made it one sided for myself when I kinda slaughtered Calvin's army....er 'army.' Then the first game against Jason. Offense never beats Defense =P, as I would show in Game 1 as I absolutely killed Jason. But 2nd game......well technically I lost........pointwise but we aren't playing by that are we hehe. So yeah.........I lost all my pieces......cept my King and Jason still had King, Queen, and a Knight. he still never checkmated me lmao. Our game stopped when Pastor Mackness stopped us for the fellowship to officially commence. Oh yeah and the others had a seriously pathetic game of Twister lol.  The video......was featuring an American woman. She had an awesome message though. And her charisma reminds me of that motivational speaker we had this year at the beginning in September. She had some jokes......but also her message was really serious. It was about how intercourse is really a gift from God that shouldn't be altered from its status. In simplified terms......don't do it until after marriage. It's really benefiting though in the end I guess....won't have to go through all the annoying crap @ 30 when you're only 15, 16, etc. So really its saving you trouble. Heh and she also brought up another subject, the fact that after sex girls and guys care WAAAY more about pregnancy than something like STD's. And how abortion can bite you in the ass........she told a story about how some girl had abortion......but while they were taking out the baby they kinda pulled out her intestinal tract by accident *shudder* or sometin like that and the fact she was hemorraging afterwards, and had to go through ER. Now she can't have kids or go the the bathroom properly. That kinda gave me the creeps. But yeah there were a few funny jokes she told.......like the one about how she used to always wonder why teens seem to not understand the concept of sex w/ only your marriage partner and after marriage......but then again the President of the United States seems to not understand this 'complicated' concept either. This video I'm guessin was made in 98 when Bill Clinton had the affair w/ Lewinsky. Dissed by his own country's citizen on a worldwide video. Ouch=P.  Well got home now.......and I am blogging. This one might not be THAT exciting....but *shrug.* Like I said it was just another average day. But yeah...........13 days and counting before March break.....and 18 more days until Senior TC 2004. WHOO! Lates.         ",5538,1000,Blasted Leap year postponing TC...Bah It's unfortunate how much difference one day can make I was at my piano lesson today and when I read the date February th I thought SWEET TOMORROW'S

416,416,2587254,1,15,"              4/24/04   So much for adjusting back to normal life...   Heh seems like a ritorical statement I made yesterday about me going back to normal. Truthfully....after today....yeah a normal average Joe life still hasn't gone by. Today was just as hectic and crazy as any other day of this week lol. So today's Saturday was a really fun, exciting, and jumbled addition to the rest of my week. Very fun though......as mentioned before plus tried Greek cuisine for the first time in my life today...which I must say is GOOOOD!  With Kiwanis over, I decided to slack off this week from piano. It's kinda at the bottom of my list now with theory and other things to finish. so today.....being the lazy one that I am...I woke up around 1130ish. Ahh yes sleep....but then the annoyance of being waked up by the aroma of a barbecue getting up and running. Ok so not ANNOYING exactly but.....still disturbing lol. The aroma of BBQ sauce dripping into the fire, the sizzling of the steak being BBQ'd and all....yeeeeah it was a good aroma lol. So falling into the temptation *OH NO.....TEMPTATION* I quickly ran downstairs, grabbed a plate, rice, and quickly ran out to the wood deck to grab a piece of steak. Yeah savouring the previews to this afternoon's BBQ day for my English Service....mmmmmmmm good steak ^_^. So after eating that steak.....headed out the door for my usual Saturday piano lesson.  Lalalala.....yup at piano lessons now. Like usual congratulates me on my achievements in Kiwanis....and she even thought was total b/s how some girl won playing a piece that was out of the rules. Grr....coulda got two seconds =@! Oh well.....least I still won something I guess....not everything's a win win situation. Today didn't do much actual playing.....more of 'Joe let's mark your theory....even though you're coming later!' So yeah now I've got all my theory marked....and I am still on my quest to complete final 5 papers. Pray for me to finish 'em by May 5th lol. Procrastination is not the key in this case =P. Oh yeah and apparently Mrs. Mitsis told that Helen person to look for me at  school because she needs help on Latin Prelude....which I'm pretty good at. OOOOK so she's not a stalker *whew* lol.  Got home after lesson.....and to my not-so-surprised self everyone was there at the BBQ already. Mmm....the food.....and everything....yeah good times this afternoon. So much steak....and the salad was pretty good too. Dad came through again for being the master chef he is.....and really cooked up a good meal today for everyone. Think 50 people showed up in the end.....pretty crowded out in backyard though. Fun times though....with all the jokes and stuff. The steak instantly reminded me, Josh and Gavin about Ju Pah.....lol plus we would be reminded @ Mykono's also =P. Oh yeah and I've now set the bar of insect classification as this:  'Anything below 5 feet is an insect...' *COUGHREBECCACOUGH!*  Well in the end that burn didn't work anyways....since she's past the 5 foot mark now lol....and Jenn I think just misses that mark too haha=P.  Well after eating...we headed downstairs to watch my newly bought movie....KILL BILL *again.* I've seen it 3 times already in two days....and the 3rd time watching it today was no different. I'm still somehow amused by the movie...  So yeah pretty much everyone thought was pretty good movie. Many think it's funny how the excessive blood squirting is amusing *I did a bit.....I mean it does sorta look like fruit punch* and also few of 'em liked my favourite part with the 'Wiggle your big toe.' I won't reveal much of the movie.....so go rent/buy it on your own =P. *Shudder* one downside/upside of showing the movie today though....  First the downside:  CALVIN CAN'T EVER SHUT UP DURING A MOVIE! Throughout the movie he'd honestly ask some of the dumbest questions ever. I mean not trying to be mean....but when someone's squirting litres of blood....THEY'RE DEAD CALVIN. Also CORN POPS DON'T RANDOMLY FIRE OUT LIKE A BULLET FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE CEREAL BOX.....as he somehow cluelessly thought does.  But the upside:  Calvin can never deny his somewhat often occuring stupidity ever again =P. This is going to haunt him for a while....and as Gavin says:  'You are now officially out of the movie watchers club. The club: everyone else.'  Jokes jokes Calvin....but honestly smarten up at times lol.  So after watching the  movie for the 3rd time....it was four....wait....FOUR!? CRAP! And I quickly rush out to car and dad drove me to theory class....EMERGENCY THEORY CLASS. Everyone else was still at my place.....so don't know what they did lol. But on my perspective of the afternoon.....  Yup....so I got to my theory class late....but meh s'all good I'm only just trying to find some time to really cram in some theory....which I managed to do. Started paper 10, and did a lot in the other ones. Also chatted with the few people I knew there *NO ONE FROM THEORY 3 WHY!?* so managed to talk with Jaclyn and Lindsay while there lol. Though I'm mostly totally out of the bubble they have, there were a few things we could relate to. Normally I don't really see 'em much at school....hmm I think mainly because I guess I chill w/ different people? Not that I don't like em....actually they real cool people...just rarely seem em lol. So sat a round there until 5:15....where after a photo or two and grabbing a donut *something we get everytime at a theory 'clinic' hobbled out of her house and then jumped in my car.....and off to Mykono's we go!  Judging this restaurant is like judging a book by its cover. The outside....when I saw it for the first time *er noticed it more like* my first thought:  'O M G I'm going to this dump for dinner on Saturday?'  Turns out I was totally wrong...the inside is actually pretty sweet.....and plus their little tented area where our HYPE group sat in....was pretty cool =P. So well....the HYPE counselors like usual arrived according to Chinese time *around 15 minutes late* and Ali couldn't manage to find Mykono's until she called Brian lol. Theresa thought the same as me also from what I heard about the whole....'eew we going to this shack?' but in the end it all worked out I think. Well at least for me it did....I don't complain about a restaurant that serves REALLY good food. Few people ordered souvlakis, one table just ordered an appetizer plate or two to share among themselves....Josh ordered this kickass Greek coffee and some steak meal...and I got myself Greek-Style Lasagna and a Frappe. Aww crap forgot the word for greek coffee w/out sugar now. But gotta try that next time. Coffee tasted like coffee....with a tang of 'huong dow saah' *cheesy direct translation to 'red bean dessert'* lol. My frappe was amazin'....plus the greek lasagna.....*mmm.....lasagna.* Oh yeah and Greek salad I've never actually known to be this good. Feta cheese on salad is actually a great combo. I think I'm gonna become a lover of Greek cuisine now after today...gotta go there again =P. Plus ONLY PLACE I'VE EVER SEEN IN LONDON THAT SELLS LAMB CHOPS! So those meats they sell at meat shops labelled 'Lamb' does get business from some places lol.  So after that scrumptous and eye-opening dinner into a new world of cuisine....I hopped into Kendrick's car along with Dan, Jason, and Gavin and we headed to BKung's place. Lol but before that....the crazy car rides that Kendrick somehow manages. First off.....drag racing a Jetta Vs. Brian's Protoge....LOL hilarious. Jetta killed the little Jap Lawn Mower.....and we then stopped by at a Shopper's Drug Mart to buy some food and stuff for tonight....so did that....then back we went into Kendrick's Crayonmobile *it smells like crayons for some reason.* And off to Brian's.  *Sigh* yeah tonight's the last meeting for JT and Ali. We'll be missin' em a lot...and on a personal note:  Thanks JT and Ali for all you two have done for our HYPE group along with the other counselors. May Christ keep on shining within in you guys in whatever future paths you may step into. We'll all miss you always...and you both will be in my mind forever....with the amount of work you've put into helping LCAC grow furthermore and putting a HUGE stepping stone in my Walk of Faith....or if you want a big boost for me. Thanks a lot to both of you guys.....and keep in touch!  But before that....we had some time of fellowship. Tonight just getting closer with one another with many games and just chillin' with people. Played some Bible Pictionary, and then after that the card game 'Killer.' They then went on to play Yuker....but me, Jason, and some other people decided to hit the X-Box with Gotham racing and NBA Street. Lol Two point games with 12 second shot clock in NBA street were hilarious. In the end I think JT and Brian killed me and Jason but we pulled off some pretty sweet stuff still lol. Ali had to leave early though.....but we all still managed to sign her journal and JT's before the day was at end. Kinda cool though with the whole journal thing....I want one now lol. Hmm for now though.....we chilled....then headed out around 10pm or so....and this was basically where my day ended.   Hmm.......so guess now I'll be headin' to bed. Church tomorrow plus some badminton practice. Also gotta find my band uniform at Bud Gowan's tomorrow for Kiwanis on Tuesday. So hehe....until tomorrow's entry. Later people =).         ",5671,1000,So much for adjusting back to normal life Heh seems like a ritorical statement I made yesterday about me going back to normal Truthfully....after today....yeah a normal average Joe life still hasn't gone by Today was just as hectic and crazy as any other day of this week lol So today's Saturday was a really fun exciting and jumbled addition to the rest of my week Very fun though......as mentioned before plus tried Greek cuisine for the first time in my life today...which I must say is GOOOOD With Kiwanis over I decided to slack off this week from piano It's kinda at the bottom of my list now with theory and other things to finish so today.....being the lazy one that I am...I woke up around ish Ahh yes sleep....but then the annoyance of being waked up by the aroma of a barbecue getting up and running Ok so not ANNOYING exactly but.....still disturbing lol The aroma of BBQ sauce dripping into the fire the sizzling of the steak being BBQ'd and all....yeeeeah it was a good aroma lol So falling into the temptation OH NO.....TEMPTATION I quickly ran downstairs grabbed a plate rice and quickly ran out to the wood deck to grab a piece of steak Yeah savouring the previews to this afternoon's BBQ day for my English Service....mmmmmmmm good steak So after eating that steak.....headed out the door for my usual Saturday piano lesson Lalalala.....yup at piano lessons now Like usual congratulates me on my achievements in Kiwanis....and she even thought was total b/s how some girl won playing a piece that was out of the rules Grr....coulda got two seconds Oh well.....least I still won something I guess....not everything's a win win situation Today didn't do much actual playing.....more of Joe let's mark your theory....even though you're coming later So yeah now I've got all my theory marked....and I am still on my quest to complete final papers Pray for me to finish em by May th lol Procrastination is not the key in this case P Oh yeah and apparently Mrs Mitsis told that Helen person to look for me at school because she needs help on Latin Prelude....which I'm pretty good at OOOOK so she's not a stalker whew lol Got home after lesson.....and to my not-so-surprised self everyone was there at the BBQ already Mmm....the food.....and everything....yeah good times this afternoon So much steak....and the salad was pretty good too Dad came through again for being the master chef he is.....and really cooked up a good meal today for everyone Think people showed up in the end.....pretty crowded out in backyard though Fun times though....with all the jokes and stuff The steak instantly reminded me Josh and Gavin about Ju Pah.....lol plus we would be reminded Mykono's also P Oh yeah and I've now set the bar of insect classification as this Anything below feet is an insect COUGHREBECCACOUGH Well in the end that burn didn't work anyways....since she's past the foot mark now lol....and Jenn I think just misses that mark too haha=P Well after eating...we headed downstairs to watch my newly bought movie....KILL BILL again I've seen it times already in two days....and the rd time watching it today was no different I'm still somehow amused by the movie So yeah pretty much everyone thought was pretty good movie Many think it's funny how the excessive blood squirting is amusing I did a bit.....I mean it does sorta look like fruit punch and also few of em liked my favourite part with the Wiggle your big toe I won't reveal much of the movie.....so go rent/buy it on your own P Shudder one downside/upside of showing the movie today though First the downside CALVIN CAN'T EVER SHUT UP DURING A MOVIE Throughout the movie he'd honestly ask some of the dumbest questions ever I mean not trying to be mean....but when someone's squirting litres of blood....THEY'RE DEAD CALVIN Also CORN POPS DON'T RANDOMLY FIRE OUT LIKE A BULLET FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE CEREAL BOX.....as he somehow cluelessly thought does But the upside Calvin can never deny his somewhat often occuring stupidity ever again P This is going to haunt him for a while....and as Gavin says You are now officially out of the movie watchers club The club everyone else Jokes jokes Calvin....but honestly smarten up at times lol So after watching the movie for the rd time....it was four....wait....FOUR CRAP And I quickly rush out to car and dad drove me to theory class....EMERGENCY THEORY CLASS Everyone else was still at my place.....so don't know what they did lol But on my perspective of the afternoon Yup....so I got to my theory class late....but meh s'all good I'm only just trying to find some time to really cram in some theory....which I managed to do Started paper and did a lot in the other ones Also chatted with the few people I knew there NO ONE FROM THEORY WHY so managed to talk with Jaclyn and Lindsay while there lol Though I'm mostly totally out of the bubble they have there were a few things we could relate to Normally I don't really see em much at school....hmm I think mainly because I guess I chill w different people Not that I don't like em....actually they real cool people...just rarely seem em lol So sat a round there until where after a photo or two and grabbing a donut something we get everytime at a theory clinic hobbled out of her house and then jumped in my car.....and off to Mykono's we go Judging this restaurant is like judging a book by its cover The outside....when I saw it for the first time er noticed it more like my first thought O M G I'm going to this dump for dinner on Saturday Turns out I was totally wrong...the inside is actually pretty sweet.....and plus their little tented area where our HYPE group sat in....was pretty cool P,93,test
419,419,2587254,1,15,"              4/11/04   Another Sister of Christ Baptized: Many congrats Steph =)   Hehe to think that 8 years ago we were all in Sunday School learning songs like 'Jesus Loves Me' and winning food if we could memorize a Bible Verse. And to think now, 8 years later, in 2004, I'm sitting in the pews today listening to one of my fellow HYPE members Stephanie Chan, giving her testimony and anointed with the Holy Water, representing her full affirmation of Accept Jesus Christ. Yeah it was a pretty cool and touching sight. I mean as she was being baptized, even I was thinking:  'Wow.....to think we were all little 7 year olds trying to memorize Words of Faith for gifts and prizes. Now, we try to remember Words of Faith to bring others to Christ and gain Spiritual gifts and prizes, and to fight off the temptations of Satan.'  Ok that is a little bit more fancy wording, but it was basically around the area of that =P. Another thought that popped up I guess *as of every other baptism I've attended* I started to wonder 'when will it be my time?' Only God can tell =).  Well this happy day started off with my usual morning awakening to another sunny day. Hmm....weird I woke up at 830.......WTH 730?! Ugh stupid clock fooling me.....er eyes. So yeah slept for another hour. False alarm hehe =P.  *1 Hour later*  OK NOW IT'S ACTUALLY 830 *unlike that stupid fake 830 an hour ago* and now I'm alive and about. Walked downstairs, ate, got dressed, usual hygiene morning routine....and WOOSH! I'm out the door! Went to pick up Lina for her first day at LCAC *wonder if she liked it* and then off to pick up Jason also. Then usual 5 min drive from Jason's to the church.  Hmm......got there pretty early today. Mike, Dan and mom came today which was nice to see. Really hope those two dudes can bring their whole family one day....got real big hopes on em hahaha *pressure's ondudes.* Jokes jokes. So headed upstairs......was pretty cool seein' Gavin leading worship. Yeah and Ali Austin and Chris were also up there today. Hmmm....thinkin' about it bummer.....this is gonna be Ali's 3rd last time leading worship? Graduatin' so yeah I think it's either 3rd or 4th last time. 5th maybe? There's my math skills for you hehe. Ushered for a bit before Brian finally got there, and Wendy took my spot in place of Gloria. And then service started.  Today started off like usual....opening prayer and then songs of praise. Afterwards though.....Steph said her testimonial. Hmm......if I'm not wrong is she the first English testimonial person? Even if not that, she's the first HYPEr to be testifying before baptism hehe. It was actually a very touching story.....I won't say anything though as I don't know if she would want me to post it up on MY blog. It is her story....so I'll let her tell it =P. So listened to her story, and then afterwards Pastor D went on with his sermon after Carmen read Scripture. Today's story: Easter story....er actually more of the story of what HYPE studied last night: how we benefited from Christ dying and rising from the tomb in 3 days. It was actually pretty interesting what he had to say though...  Before that though......ouch much bashing on the dentist kids @ UWO in LCAC today hahaha.  'Yup......though there is much suffering and pain in this world....to think one day all of it will be gone, and I'll be in heaven, way from war, pain, suffering, sadness.....and dentists.'   Dentists not needed in heaven? Jokes haha....but yeah still just the moment when he said it lol.....everyone just turns to Jesse and laughs *Jesse slowly hides behind church bulletin.*  Pastor D was saying how obviously many of us in this world will say 'how did we benefit? What changed? I mean, there's still pain, suffering, sorrow, etc.' But when you think about it.....and it even shows in Bible..Christ gave us the boldness and courage to go out and preach to the world about the wonders that God has done for us. Before Christ died, the Apostles were even kinda shaky about the Faith, and even fled when Jesus was arrested. However, after Christ rose, they would die, and even be crucified just to stand up for Christ. So yeah changes and benefits did come, but sometimes we are just too blind to see it. So yeah just a bit of a heads up for me even I guess.....I mean it's always good to have reminders like that so we won't be led astray.  After the service *which Lina said actually wasn't that bad* we headed downstairs for refreshments. OH YEAH CALVIN'S NOW OFFICIALLY REFRESHMENTS CO-ORDINATOR HAHAHA. CONGRATS MAN lol. Actually it's cool seein' us all gettin' more involved in church.....it's a start.......funny one but it is a job hehe. Cookies were good though so good start Calvin haha. So chatted, ate, you know usual stuff and then headed to class.  Yes class today....HILARIOUS lol. We wrote stories....er more of news articles of what news might have been back then when Christ rose. This was me and Josh's interpretation:   THE WOMEN WHO CRIED RISEN!  The Good Book said He would rise in three days. And right it was. Early this morning, local prostitute turned Catapult Dynamics Enginner Dr. Mary Magdeline was going to pay her respects to Jesus, a recently crucified carpenter/teacher when she found the tomb opened. The 54 ton rock guarding the carven tomb was rolled away. 'I was surprised to see that the guards were not there. With my knowledge of wedge-tool dynamics, I concluded that no wedge-tool could have removed a rock of that magnitude with such magnitude! It was inconceivable!' She also reported that she and friend Mary 'Mother of James' Smith encountered an angel at the tomb. The angel told them to 'Go out and tell the others' that Jesus had risen. On their hasty way, Jesus apparently appeared to them. Smith tells us: 'Dude! It was totally rad. Like, Jesus totally rose from the dead. He was right there and we fell down and praised Him! We got to touch his feet too! It was totally far out.' Rumour has it that over 500 people have also seen the risen Jesus. However, that remains to be proven and this reporter, for one, will not report the senseless chatter of blabbering midwives. This is Jahoravich DingleShmienz reporting for the National Inquirer.'   You like? Haha Hope you did took me 3 minutes to type *OH NO!* So after that fun filled class we headed upstairs to watch Steph's baptismal, and of course the others. Heh Josh got the video and I got the pics. Argh stupid recharge time....only got 3 pics lol. Well s'all good.....the point is I'll remember it....since she is the first HYPE kid to be baptized. Once again....many congrats Steph =P. So after the baptism headed back downstairs for some chattin', and pictures w/ Steph. Yeah she got flowers, gifts, you know.......cool stuff hahaha. And yeah picture taking was funny lol. I had to head out early though.....had to go home and help chop down Mr. Tree in my backyard....the one that's been back there for....well as long as I've been around hehe. Since I was born lol...well right when we moved in so 13 years. yeah big old tree. Never noticed it till today lol.  So got home....ate.....Jason came over for a bit too....was on compy while I chopped down tree. STUPID TREE SAP.....ugh so friggin' sticky. It's like glue...but smells like crap and probably tastes like it too lol. So did that quickly then headed down for some games of NBA street and NFL street. WOW lots of wasted time.....BUT WHO CARES POINT IS IT WAS FUN =P. So did that until Jason had to leave....and then drummed for an hour, then ate, and then......  And then........PLANNING FOR TOMORROW WHICH WAS UTTER FAILURE. Though my day didn't end off too well......I am always seeming to be on optimistic side.....and well yeah I looked on bright side here too. I mean though Josh can't make it to the planning tomorrow nor Rebecca, me Gavin and maybe Carmen will still push ahead and try to come up with as much as we can. Well we still got a few days so no worries hehe. Praise night ain't till Sunday anyways. Well after thinking more.....isn't that bad I guess. I mean...who knows....God could be doing this for a reason. I mean............predestination.....it exists. Everything's planned. So yeah there is definitely a reason why Josh can't make it tomorrow.....and I'll leave it be for Christ to reaveal to me how it was for the best hehe.  Anyways....yeah I'm out for the night. Gotta wake up, do theory, read, finish math, then head to Gavin's tomorrow early hehe. Later boy's n' girls =P.  OH YES HOW COULD I ALMOST FORGET..........MAISIE MAD PROPS FOR HELPIN' ME WITH MATH TODAY Lol. Thanks a bunch =).

426,426,2587254,1,15,"              1/30/04   3 Day weekend start! Sweet....   What a relaxing day it was. And also random. Well originally I was gonna go session today @ UCC but then decided not to because I was REALLY lazy. Well for a PD day it was well spent........bought a new PS2 Game, saw a movie, and figured out Friendster (www.friendster.com) sorta. I still don't get why the heck people don't just use MSN. It's kinda cool though I guess....But most exciting part of day today was probably the sudden change in the afternoon from breakdancing to seeing a movie. I don't regret that descision.....unless I could all of a sudden pull flares in one night which I REALLY doubt.  My day started off slow........woke up around 11ish, just because I was getting bored of sleeping for the morning. Unfortunately mom wasn't awake yet so I didn't really have a breakfast. Well....it was 11 so I guess I might as well just have lunch. Mom ordered pizza though......so in the end the pizza cancelled out the no food when I wake up. Mmmmmm.......Hawaiian pizza......so good. The other one had tomatoes *what's the point when you have tomato sauce?* so I didn't really touch it. Well after that got my daily dose of tea to wake me up and down to the comp I go to check MSN and email.  Yes I just realized something. The monitor says WOW......but my tin can speakers are yelling at me to buy new ones. They do suck a lot though. The button '3D sound' makes the speakers louder that's all. Well for 5 bucks can't complain.....actually I got them for free. My uncle bought them since my old speakers died out. Probably from when I dropped them on the UCC floor but no one knows....except the people that saw it happen.  But other than that.....I called up Jason and got Adrian to play SC. Jason then came and his friend 'Sauron' came again. We played some SC, and then eventually we'd be doing that for about two hours. It was pretty fun. I pissed off Jason by basically  luring the enemy to his base. Then we lost that game. In another round which we won.....Adrian would mass lings, Jason would do most of the work, and Sauron ran to my base since he kinda got obliviated 10 minutes into the game. Well after a while I decided to find Sauron a new base. However Jason would do the same but I wouldn't know. Well in the end he ran to Jason's base......and I wasted a crapload of men for nothing. Well in the end I'd make profits back by mining from the base. So I wasn't really complaining. We then watched the replay of the game after. After that I decided that I've been sitting in front of the comp too long. So I decided to go finish some piano practice. Then I went to drum for a bit. Then it was time to go. I was already late to pick up Jason but Meh not like anyone's gonna be there earlier than us.....  Oh yeah just before the leaving for movie thing......well apparently we weren't gonna go see Last Samurai anymore *WHOO HOO MOVIE TIME COMES THROUGH AND FOILS PLAN.* Instead we were gonna go see Butterfly Effect. Meh. Beats watching a movie I've seen again. Though I did sorta wanna see Cold Mountain but Dictatorship was not the descision-making tool in this situation unfortunately or I would have won. Instead it was a Democracy. Gah foiled once again by freedom....not saying it's bad but I wish Dictatorship was there at that moment so I'd win ^_^. Ok.....we'll make it sound better. Replace Dictatorship with Communism. There happy =P? But anyways back to the going to movie thing and how I think we'd be the first ones to arrive.....  Boy was I wrong. Josh's punctuation came through again. He was there earlier than us. Called Jason on our way there on cell. I was surprised he was there. Well I went to deposit cheque in Scotiabank from Chinese New Year money, and then we went to Zellers to buy Jason's Friends Season Six. Zellers of course is a cheap store, so in the end they didn't have it. I was gonna buy Silent Hill 3 there but I thought maybe I should check out EB first. Well Jason then bought the Season 6 from HMV and then we'd go to EB...  WOW I was lucky I didn't buy Silent Hill 3 from Zellers. They sold it for 50 and I got it for 30....though it was used who cares it was in good condition.  Jason was gonna pre-order SC Ghost (I was too but forgot) but in the end we didn't because this family in front of us took friggin forever to buy ONE GAME. The kid traded in like 50 games and he still had to pay money afterwards lol. What a rip off. I think he probably lost over $100 in value in the end. Idiot. Anyways after we left EB we finally got back Silvercity....where we'd find Steph and Rebecca waiting for us in the theatre. Was gonna play DDR but not enough time....  Now we sit in the movie. There were a few movies that looked ok. Well I sorta forgot except for Dawn of the Damned.....it looked ok I guess. Thought it'd be Resident Evil 2 but nope.......cheap imitation of it. Same sorta storyline, except instead of one person fighting them all off it's a group. Wow big change. And there was another movie.......that was like You Got Served except Cuban style. I bet it'll bomb too since You Got Served only got 1.5 stars out of 5. It looked pretty stupid.....only reason why I'd even go see it is because of breakdancing....but why not go to UCC and watch people breakdance there? IT'S FREE! Hmm....there was another movie......gah forgot what it was. OH YEAH! This one movie about this cop being stalked and something about 'how can you track it when it's tracking you?' Forgot what it's called though but it looks cool. Has Ashley Judd, Samuel L. Jackson, and some other person in it. Some white guy. He's famous I know but I forgot his name. Anyways now time for our Feature Presentation. Wow I should be a movie commentator.^_^.No maybe not. I'd be cut...  The movie was pretty good.....I won't ruin any of it though, so you go find out yourself. Steph was jumpy through the whole thing lol and Rebecca was hiding under her coat for a bit of it. THAT was hysterical. I was surprised to see that Ashton Kutcher can actually be serious though. It was actually a REALLY good movie. Though I was confused for some of it......in the end it all tied together. I'd actually wanna go see that movie again. Well maybe not....but I think it's a DVD buyer for sure. Try not to pirate it it's really worth seeing.  Well after the movie I played DDR with Josh at Silvercity. I've really got VERY out of shape. I can't even play heavy D2R anymore. I got a D on it *shudder* but somehow I managed a C for Hysteria. Meh. I really need a new pad......and a mod chip....and DDR Extreme.  Or if I'm rich enough I'd just buy the machine from Japan. ^_^. But I don't exactly have  10k handy so no. Anyways after playing some DDR, and watching some white kid suck at it lol I got a ride from Jason to my house.....where I'd find out I'm the only one home. Not much to do at 10pm though.  Well now I'm gonna go eat, finish some piano, then play Silent Hill 3 for a bit. Then sleep. So I'll blog more tomorrow as usual. Wonder what the seminar is gonna be like. Hope it's gonna be somewhat amusing. Heard it's in english so no need to strain to listen to Chinese. Well I'm Gone. Later.

we'd be the first ones to arrive Boy was I wrong Josh's punctuation came through again He was there earlier than us Called Jason on our way there on cell I was surprised he was there Well I went to deposit cheque in Scotiabank from Chinese New Year money and then we went to Zellers to buy Jason's Friends Season Six Zellers of course is a cheap store so in the end they didn't have it I was gonna buy Silent Hill there but I thought maybe I should check out EB first Well Jason then bought the Season from HMV and then we'd go to EB WOW I was lucky I didn't buy Silent Hill from Zellers They sold it for and I got it for though it was used who cares it was in good condition Jason was gonna pre-order SC Ghost I was too but forgot but in the end we didn't because this family in front of us took friggin forever to buy ONE GAME The kid traded in like games and he still had to pay money afterwards lol What a rip off I think he probably lost over in value in the end Idiot Anyways after we left EB we finally got back Silvercity....where we'd find Steph and Rebecca waiting for us in the theatre Was gonna play DDR but not enough time Now we sit in the movie There were a few movies that looked ok Well I sorta forgot except for Dawn of the Damned.....it looked ok I guess Thought it'd be Resident Evil but nope.......cheap imitation of it Same sorta storyline except instead of one person fighting them all off it's a group Wow big change And there was another movie.......that was like You Got Served except Cuban style I bet it'll bomb too since You Got Served only got stars out of It looked pretty stupid.....only reason why I'd even go see it is because of breakdancing....but why not go to UCC and watch people breakdance there IT'S FREE Hmm....there was another movie......gah forgot what it was OH YEAH This one movie about this cop being stalked and something about how can you track it when it's tracking you Forgot what it's called,112,test
427,427,2587254,1,15,"              3/14/04   2nd Annual HYPE Exec Meeting: Productive (Kinda at least=P)   First Sunday of March Break, and also the countdown still continues to TC 2004. Yeah I'm pretty hyped about it right now still, and just seeing how quickly time is flying by, wow. But yeah so far my March Break has been.........lazy. VERY lazy. So far it's consisted of sleeping, sleeping, and dreaming lol. I dunno why but I've always been fascinated with dreams. Who knows maybe my mom naming me in the hopes I'll be like the Joseph from the Bible has an effect to it =P. By the way I mean the Joseph and the Technicolour Dreamcoat Joseph not the one that was with Mary. By the way if you don't know why I'm saying the 1st Joseph it's because he could fortell dreams, and the actual story does have a bit more sadness in it. But anyways, enough about that for now I guess....I'm not about to let go my whole life history =P. So yeah...to begin my March Break Sunday...  Today I had one of the strangest dreams I've ever had in my life. I mean, I don't even know if I should put it on my blog. I mean it was REALLY weird. I mean it wasn't really about me......it was about one of my friends. I don't know if I'll even share it with her. Oh well.....in time it may come out though but right at the moment I think I need more reflection about it than speaking out. Thing is though it's about.....well suffering for Christ I suppose. That's as far as I'll go for now......details may come later on in this blog when I feel I've done enough reflection. But yeah lately I've been having REALLY strange dreams. Unfortunately some exciting one's I can't remember *blasted short term memory grrrr.*  Well after that, since my dad was in the bathroom, I decided to go on MSN. and lo and behold Gerty was on. She told me she knew of the plan of meeting up @ TC by recognizing me wearing........A BRIGHT GREEN SHIRT?! I said GREEN not BRIGHT GREEN JENN! Lol so yeah after going through that confusion....well yeah now it's final......YOU'LL SEE A DUDE WEARING A HAT, GREEN ADIDAS SHIRT.....AND HAVE A TIME MAGAZINE  BAG lol.  So after pondering about that in bed for a bit, I did my morning routine and then headed out for church. No lift for Jason today......since he's in Toronto. What a smurf. Same for Mike and Dan=P. Jokes all jokes dudes. So today I got to church relatively in a more relaxed way, since I didn't have to worry about taking anyone to church with me. Got there, chatted w/ the people for a bit, then me and Wendy did ushering for today.  Today....sermon theme was......ooooh boy I really have a crummy memory lol. But I do remember the memory verse was Hebrews 9:14, which reads:   'How much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death, so that we may serve the living God!'  Now if I remember correctly, one thing that the guest speaker Don Hill did talk about today was the power and superiority of God. That was the main title, but I don't remember the EXACT words. But basically the message today was how Christ, who came to the earth to die for us, did what 10,000 animal sacrifices could never do......and that is give us new life. So yeah I really did like today's sermon. Lol the speaker made fun of Chris a bit. Heh seems like everyone loves to make fun of the guy. Poor dude lol. But yeah speaker was pretty cool today. He had a comedic sense. Usually comedy/ real life experiences really get my attention in sermons. Oh yeah and on a side note, for me preparing a prayer during song of respone for offering didn't work lol. I choked more than I normally did. Ehehehehe gotta work on public speaking more even though I like it=P.  So yeah after that we had a Sunday school class with none other......than our HYPE counselor ALI! Today we learned about how basically the whole english term 'two heads are better than one' saying works. I mean in the Bible even it talks about it. We studied Ecclesiastes chapter 4 today. It was speaking of a man who had no one to turn to, and how he was fairly depressed. Then it spoke of many analogies about how we should stick together to make life easier for one another. Also we spoke about how Christians are encouraged to marry other Christians, as people with more things in common probably get along better right =P. So the idea of people that have common likes/dislikes living together is like a team of oxen. If you have one big and one small oxen, life is a bit more difficult to plow the field (the plowed part being life's achievements). However if you have two even built oxen, the job is done faster, quicker, and the things you accomplish in life may look better (better quality plowed field). So yeah I really liked today's lesson also. A great day at church if you ask me hehe. Oh yeah Victor came back from the land Down Under again *AUSTRALIA for those shmucks out  there* and yeah chatted w/ him for a bit. Apparently he did break his arm in the accident but he looks healthy.  Then today was Communion, so we went upstairs. Well, me Ken Josh and Gavin stayed back to put out tables and chairs for the special lunch we have every Communion Sunday. Today was also the 2nd monthly HYPE exec meeting. The meeting went by fairly quickly, and I liked how the counselors really listened to me and Josh. It was pretty interesting meeting, and I felt we had accomplished lots of tasks to be completed in that meeting. I really am happy for the changes that have happened to my church. Our church's English/Youth ministry has never been better I think. Today's meeting also marks how close we are to summer holidays (for UWO students) and how some of them are leaving =(. But then again, this does happen, and we can only pray for the best for these people. *Sigh* but it seems so weird......in a matter of a year or two Josh Lo can be a counselor. So weird lol. But yeah we had a pretty good meeting, went over many issues/hopes for the future of HYPE. One main thing is getting our room painted. It's still sorta halfway done only lol. After this meeting *which was GOOD.....yes GOOD* it was time to go home.  Well.............first nap in car *ZZzzZZZzzZZzzzz* and then got home.  And to my surprise........DAVID'S HERE? Weird thought the kid wasn't comin but yeah came home and he was hoggin' my comp w/ Subspace. Wow...............weird lol. He seemed so bored too lol. But oh well yeah s'all good. So yeah he was playin comp, and I decided I'd nap. Yeah today and yesterday have compiled of nap, nap, and more nap. What a immense combo. MMADDDDD.   *WUMP* Nap time =).  And then after a shweet nap, went to Dave's grandma's house for dinner. REALLY boring. I was dying there. lucky I made a deal with parents to be back by 8 or they are paying me $$$ lol.  SO yeah now I'm at home bloggin', typical blog endin' for me. Yeah I can't believe it's only 10:30pm right now. Feels like it's friggin' 1am. I guess it's just because my day's passed by so quick, and I've done so much tonight already (blogged, slept, MSN, PS2, Dave's over and typing up Bio notes for Underhill for project). Anyways yeah I guess I'm goin on SC for a bit, then headin for the the hay and more Dreams. Hehe lates.

437,437,2587254,1,15,"              3/21/04   Early Blog....there's sometin new   Blogging at 230?! From ME!? NOOOOOO WAY! Well yeah believe it....it's happenin' right now. Yeah today I'm gonna basically be cooped up in my house anyways.....drumming, h/w, etc etc. So much work to do today that I kinda shoved behind me from March Break. Then again who doesn't do that hehe. So yeah I'm officially settled back into my slow-paced hick life.....filled with loads of sleep, piano, drumming, and blogging. Of course though I'm gonna keep on pushin' on the goals I've set for myself at TC. But just from last night after I stopped blogging until even now....I'm still thinking of all the crazy stuff that's happened these past few days. I mean I felt God's presence just.....so much more I guess. Now I'm realizin' that before when I complained about God not being there for me or sometin', really it's just me being too ignorant to even stop and listen to anyone....including God. So yeah after realizing that today during church....I'm going to try to look around everyday for how God's done something for me each day in my blog....as I know everyday he provides me with something. I just hope that I can keep this goal and that this isn't a 'spiritual high' aftermath.  Well today I woke up at usual time. Wow reflecting on your week until 3am isn't exactly MOST intelligent thing to do the night before church....but really cleared my mind. It was so weird though. While I was thinkin'......all these weird noises were coming out of my compy. Either I think too much of Silent Hill 3 (there was like a high pitched noise comin' from somewhere) or yeah sometin' weird was goin' on. Well I guess I was thinkin' at the time maybe it was time to go to sleep. So yeah headed upstairs....and then decided to read Psalm 23 tonight. I guess I'm kinda going off track with my devos.....but sometimes I just like to read the Bible on my own and not follow guidelines. So after waking up this morning.......I had a quick breakfast then ran out the door. Picked up Jason and then English Service here I come!  Today was pretty interesting for english service. Well before anything else Calvin and Carmen are on a two-game losing streak for ushering. Showed up late both times. Yeah I do realize I'm still on a hockey aftermath from the 'Spiritual hat-Trick' thing but meh I like hockey....and it does kinda make sense. Sorta. Maybe. Somewhat.....Anyways point is me and Gavin had to take over for ushering today. English service saw a new dude come in. Think his name was Greg dun really remember. But yeah hope that dude keeps on comin. Service today also took a different route.....we had TEAM Missionaries come in and speak to us.   The speaker, who's name was Charlie, spoke about well.....missionary work today. He read from Acts chapter 1, and the memory verse for this week I find pretty cool. It reads:  'But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.'  By the way that's verse 8. So from that one line the speaker Charlie was speaking about how missionaries should be witnesses all the time anywhere. Sadly I was kinda falling asleep from lack of sleep last night....so I went downstairs and slashed some water on my face to wake me up. I felt alright after that. After the sermon though.....Ali who was doing song of response w/ worship team went up and read the EXACT verse I was thinkin' about. The verse is Isaiah 6:8, which reads:  'Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, 'Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?' And I said, 'Here am I. Send me!'   I remember that verse as last year for TC 2003 I was in team Isaiah, and that verse was our 'key' verse I guess you can say. But yeah I did some thoughts on it a while back, and I just find it pretty cool how Isaiah was already so enthusiastic about doing such works. Heh these few months have shown me so many people that sacrifice so much to get to know God. I feel as though God is telling me 'Joe, you can still sacrifice much more.' I really do believe in that....as this is why I am beginning to improve my prayers and increase the time spent on devos. Oh yeah Carmen and Calvin managed to make it for offering part of their ushering task though. Least they made it. Better late than never as they say.  After service.....well my SECOND bag in FOUR DAYS broke. The strap on this one broke piece of crap lol. I hopped off of the stage and *snap.* Lucky I have a spare strap. On my TIME bag the strap was still intact, but the ring for the strap broke. So yeah I've been havin' pretty bad luck w/ duffel bags last few days. But now time for class =P.  Class today we listened to the Len Nation's story of his life. Wait I think his first name was Len. Well anyways the speaker was talking about how he ever came about to becoming a pastor and pastoring at a church. Apparently he was raised in a pretty crummy area, his parents divorced, and he just never had a decent childhood. High school he was basically the school bully, narc dealer and booze hound. But after this one even that happened.....the gov't put him into a juvie program that forced him 4000 miles away from community and they had to climb the Rockies. Basically each day was military training, and then one day.....a huge glacier avalanche came down. A barrage of snow, ice, and debris started hurtling down the hill, and him and the other juvies ran to take cover. He happened to find a big indent to hide behind for cover, and he said that as he was sitting there with all the stuff flying by he felt and pictured God 'holding him by the neck with a dagger in other hand.' But....after that....God just stood back....like backed off, as though forgiving him and giving Len mercy. See all Mr. Nation's life he's been doing everything possible against God as he hated him, but when God seemed to still forgive him, Mr. Nation was just so amazed at God's Grace. Pastor Mackness said that it's almost like the Song 'Amazing Grace,' which talks of Christ even saving a wretch like the composer. So yeah i've met some pretty cool people last few days. Pastor Bartha was just an amazin' speaker @ TC (like the story of how someone was almost 'bout to kill him but backed off when Bartha said if he died, then his word would spread even faster from the fact someone would kill him for that), Sumair for his amazin' story about how he came to Christ, and today Mr. Len Nation for basically giving us his testimony. Craaaazy stuff, but cool.  Well yeah that is basically the highlight of my day. For the rest of my day, I'm gonna be doin' the homework I've held back and just drum around. Not much variety of stuff but it's gotta be done. So yeah......until later.....Lates.

444,444,2639424,1,25,"              Sal's Corner 6/14/79    25. 25 years! 25 years old! Man O Man. Its funny that my birthday falls on a Monday. Monday is 'Sal's Corner' and on this Monday, I gotta lot to say. So light a candle, play something melodic as I go down memory lane a lil bit. As I turn 25 today, I look back and ask questions to myself. What am I doing with myself? Am I happy? What's next? and MOST important, What have I learned in 25 years???? Let's deal with that last question in particular. What HAVE I learned in 25 years?   * Nobody is gonna do you like YOU do you - Real talk playa. Example: You need a ride from the bus stop/train station. Its cold outside. Your house is up the street but your friend can easily come pick you up. 10 minutes TOPS. This is including, him/her putting on their shoes, finding keys AND driving to the station. What time does your friend end up getting there? About 20-30 minutes after you called!!! Thats just ONE example but my point is, nobody cares about your affairs like YOU do.  * You cant have nothing in the bed but a dream - My father told me that once. I'll NEVER forget it. The early bird gets the worm. If you get up at 12:00 P.M., it'll take you 6 hours to do what you could do in 3 hours if you got up at 7:00 A.M.   * LOOKS DO COUNT - Dont EVER let someone say they dont. Thats NONSENSE and dont believe it. Never judge a book by its cover, but if the cover aint good looking, you'll never pick up the book. Remember one thing, the easiest thing to change is your insides. That could be your attitude, your personality, your morals and beliefs. With effort, you can be a better person. No matter how many religions, phases or personalities you have, you are always gonna be the same person on the outside. I am a lightskin African-American male, usually keep a trimmed beard, low hair cut, so on and so on. Right now almost every person reading this article that knows me has somewhat of a different perception of me. YET, they all will describe me the SAME from a physical standpoint. But to 10 different people, I can be 10 different people. This girl might say 'he's the sweetest guy'. Shorty over there might say 'That nigga aint worth 2 cents'. This guy might say 'He's a real dude'. My man over there might say 'I cant stand the dude'. Its like this.......Straight up.......Im gonna marry a cute woman!!!! You may laugh now but if you see me wit a DUCK, point me out. Let me know 'Sal why are you out in public with this duck??' thats right, im gonna marry a cute woman and if she aint perfect, we can work on that cause Im not perfect either. We just gonna be 2 imperfect, working to be perfect people. Now she maybe cute to ME and not to yall but, at least I'M gonna find her attractive. All yall that wanna date people 'cause they are 'Financially Stable', they have a 'good career' and they are 'so NICE'........ remember this........you dont wake up to that checkbook, career or personality that your spouse has. When you look next to you in the morning that cute one is gonna look like that 'Duck' looks AFTER they done showered and got dressed! Im serious. Ladies, dont marry me if you not attracted to me!!! Im dead serious. Cause when you marry someone who you are not attracted to for real, the first thing they do that you dont like..........you getz em outta there! Cause if they not gonna be nice, WHAT ARE THEY THERE FOR?????    Note:  Some of what I'm saying is a joke but, seriously the moral of the story is not to settle. When it comes to a relationship, go for what you want and not what's available. If it's not there at this point, dont throw in your hand. When it comes to work or representing yourself, take care of yourself. Always present yourself in a good fashion. Sometimes people think that their work is all that matters. But alot of the time, no one will recognize your talents if you don't take some time out and begin to work on your physical presentation. Put that suit on or throw on some cologne or iron that shirt. Because in the end, looks do matter.  * There's no such thing as a 'Nice Person' or a 'bad person' - That person isn't nasty....... YOU JUST LET THEM TALK FUNKY TO YOU. To someone else they are the sweetest person. If you find yourself in a situation where its ALWAYS you being dogged, look in the mirror.   * Being nice gets you places that money cant take you - My mother said that to me along time ago. And it always proves to be right. Example: You might be at an event. The event maybe $50 to get in. Its a crowd outside and no one can get in. You may have $1,000,000 (A MIYON DOLLAS) in your pockets, but if you talk nasty to the person taking money, you might be outside ALL NIGHT. On the other hand, you might not have NO money. You could walk up and STILL walk right in and Ive seen it happen!!!!!  * Nobody wants to hear your problems - First, let me say life is like this.........1)You're going through a problem and cant deal with someone elses, 2) Your problem is alot BIGGER than the problem someone is bringing to you, 3) Your problem aint HALF as bad as that problem being brought to you or 4) You've been there done that and you cant see why they are tripping off of that problem. My suggestion: dont tell your problems to ANY OLE BODY. Tell it to someone who can and is known for providing good answers. That person is BOUND to fall under the 4 categories so they may brush off your problem but, at least they can give you a good option  * Dont let the opposite sex run your life - Here's a joke. A Dog is walking slowly across a train track. While walking across, a train approaches. The Dog is STILL mozying on along. The dog thinks he can make it without being hit. So he is getting off the track as the train nears. Its a close call. The Dog is ALMOST off the tracks BUT..........the train rips off his tail. The dog goes BACK on the tracks to get his tail. As he does, a train coming from the opposite way floats pass and knocks his head off. MORAL: NEVER LOSE YOUR HEAD FOR A PIECE OF TAIL.   * (For the Men) Women dont want your money - NO, they really dont. Women like the attention that money can bring. Money just happens to be an avenue that can lead to drawing major attention. No woman wants a man that no other woman wanted. And when a man is wanted, the attention is drawn. Women like to put their stamp on a man. So whether you are an athlete, businessman or the neighborhood superstar, that woman knows that despite all of your success, she can add something to you that imprints her stamp on you.   * (For the Women). Meekness is NOT Weakness. Women want strong men. I can respect that. Just understand what it is that you really want. Just because he picks the dates and he calls the shots dont make him strong. You know what MEEK means? A meek person knows they can beat you and that they are stronger than you, but they look out on your behalf. He might let you pick the place cause its your day. Maybe it doesnt MATTER where you and him go, as long as he is around you. And just because he doesn't know if he wants chicken or fish tonight does not make him a weak man either. He JUST MIGHT NOT know if he wants chicken or fish on that day! It's not that serious! Ive seen many women who like the outspoken, assertive and aggressive men and they consider that 'Strong'. Sometimes outspoken, assertive, and aggressive men are JUST LOUD, DUMB and WRONG. If I let you make the decision its only because I trust your judgment, I respect your opinion and we see eye to eye. IF and IF I dont agree......THEN you will see and hear me step forward with my opinion. See ladies, what you see as a 'Strong' man sometimes can AND will be irritating 20 years after you've gotten married. I know older women who cant even SAY A WORD to their 'Strong' husbands. Men making the decision whether you like it or not. Whether its GOOD or not. As a wife, you help your husband, but alot of these guys who you LOVE for their so- called 'strength' aint gonna even let you talk 20 years from now.  and this biggest thing I've learned is.........  * You need people - Never stray away from people. Never close yourself from those who love you. It's good to get away to clear your head but, in this battle of life, it's not all about you. What you see as being 'second-nature' maybe be a blessing for someone else. You may not think that you matter but, you do. Most of the people that you see talking to themselves downtown on a corner are those who thought they knew it all. They probably had no support group and they tried to figure it ALL out on their own. We know nothing. We really don't know anything. And when we figure that out and just take each day for what it's worth, we will be alot better off.    After my first 25 years, I can say that I've been blessed. I thank Jesus Christ for keeping me after all this time. I've been in a few situations where I could have literally died but, there is something out here for me to do so, he has kept me. I have friends that have died, doing serious jailtime or stuck in serious situations so I'm always thankful.

say So light a candle play something melodic as I go down memory lane a lil bit As I turn today I look back and ask questions to myself What am I doing with myself Am I happy What's next and MOST important What have I learned in years Let's deal with that last question in particular What HAVE I learned in years Nobody is gonna do you like YOU do you Real talk playa Example You need a ride from the bus stop/train station Its cold outside Your house is up the street but your friend can easily come pick you up minutes TOPS This is including him/her putting on their shoes finding keys AND driving to the station What time does your friend end up getting there About minutes after you called Thats just ONE example but my point is nobody cares about your affairs like YOU do You cant have nothing in the bed but a dream My father told me that once I'll NEVER forget it The early bird gets the worm If you get up at P.M it'll take you hours to do what you could do in hours if you got up at A.M LOOKS DO COUNT Dont EVER let someone say they dont Thats NONSENSE and dont believe it Never judge a book by its cover but if the cover aint good looking you'll never pick up the book Remember one thing the easiest thing to change is your insides That could be your attitude your personality your morals and beliefs With effort you can be a better person No matter how many religions phases or personalities you have you are always gonna be the same person on the outside I am a lightskin African-American male usually keep a trimmed beard low hair cut so on and so on Right now almost every person reading this article that knows me has somewhat of a different perception of me YET they all will describe me the SAME from a physical standpoint But to different people I can be different people This girl might say he's the sweetest guy Shorty over there might say That nigga aint worth cents This guy might say He's a real dude My man over there might say I cant stand the dude Its like this.......Straight up.......Im gonna marry a cute woman You may laugh now but if you see me wit a DUCK point me out Let me know Sal why are you out in public with this duck thats right im gonna marry a cute woman and if she aint perfect we can work on that cause Im not perfect either We just gonna be imperfect working to be perfect people Now she maybe cute to ME and not to yall but at least I'M gonna find her attractive All yall that wanna date people cause they are Financially Stable they have a good career and they are so NICE remember this........you dont wake up to that checkbook career or personality that your spouse has When you look next to you in the morning that cute one is gonna look like that Duck looks AFTER they done showered and got dressed Im serious Ladies dont marry me if you not attracted to me Im dead serious Cause when you marry someone who you are not attracted to for real the first thing they do that you dont like..........you getz em outta there Cause if they not gonna be nice WHAT ARE THEY THERE FOR Note Some of what I'm saying is a joke but seriously the moral of the story is not to settle When it comes to a relationship go for what you want and not what's available If it's not there at this point dont throw in your hand When it comes to work or representing yourself take care of yourself Always present yourself in a good fashion Sometimes people think that their work is all that matters But alot of the time no one will recognize your talents if you don't take some time out and begin to work on your physical presentation Put that suit on or throw on some cologne or iron that shirt Because in the end looks do matter There's no such thing as a Nice Person or a bad person That person isn't nasty YOU JUST LET THEM TALK FUNKY TO YOU To someone else they are the sweetest person If you find yourself in a situation where its ALWAYS you being dogged look in the mirror Being nice gets you places that money cant take you My mother said that to me along time ago And it always proves to be right Example You might be at an event The event maybe to get in Its a crowd outside and no one can get in You may have A MIYON DOLLAS in your pockets but if you talk nasty to the person taking money you might be outside ALL NIGHT On the other hand you might not have NO money You could walk up and STILL walk right in and Ive seen it happen

bringing to you Your problem aint HALF as bad as that problem being brought to you or You've been there done that and you cant see why they are tripping off of that problem My suggestion dont tell

452,452,2639424,1,25,"             'Commercial' by Salvador Gabor   *** Here at the Salvador Gabor Project, we do alot of what we call 'Word Play'. We love to play on words. We do this because many times, the masses use words out of context and inappropriately. So if you notice a pattern on this site with the way we 'play' with words, nevermind us, just listen. Notice the word 'listen' and not the word 'look'. We want you to HEAR this site and not just see it. Open ya ears, let this Q-tip do its job.  'Commercial'. What is 'commercial'. I've learned that a 'commercial' is an ad that promotes a product. This 'commercial' is usually about 15 to 20 seconds long. 'Commercials' do alot for the selling of a product. Super Bowl Sunday is the BIGGEST day for 'commercials'. Companies pay between $1-3 Million for a spot during that 4-hour period. I would assume that 'commercials' must be THAT important.  Then I look at society. Society says if you follow the crowd and do what others do for the sake of doing what others do, you are deemed as being 'commercial'. If everyone listens to a certain musical artist and you jump on the wagon, you are 'commercial'. If everyone is wearing a certain type of clothing and you go out and get it, you are 'commercial'. We can go on and on. But regardless, NO ONE wants to be 'commercial', now do we?  Many of us are caught in the crossfire as innocent bystanders (so to speak) when it comes to being 'commercial'. I myself, I am a 'white-tee' kinda guy. Now that the white-tee is considered to be 'commercial', I get persecuted for my apparel. Im here to say that I've been doing that style for years. I was around when it was cool to wear a white-tee out in public. Then I was still 'white-tee'n it' when the jersey's came. Now that the 'Button-Ups' are here, im still in my white-tee. Thats just me and MY example. Many of us may have more to share. But I got caught in innocent cross-fire.  Due to the word 'commercial' being used to describe 'jock-riders' and 'followers', many people overuse it and take it too seriously. Many of us go out of our way NOT to be 'commercial'. Hence the new wave of young men and women wearing 'WILD' clothing. Females with these self-made skirts and new natural hair growth. Males with these leather blazers and tight tee-shirts with 'Black Power' messages on it. Back in like 1998, this was cool. The first wave of people doing it seemed ok. I wasnt into it at all, but I respected their move. As we move into 2004, NOT being 'commercial' has become SO 'commercial'.   As we grow older, people go through several phases. We go through the 'Im tryna be in the crowd' phase. Then the 'Im doing me, so thats my excuse for not combing my hair' phase. Then the 'Im just gonna go to work and whatever happens, happens' phase. Regardless of where you are in these phases, or even if these phases dont define where you are, remember, being 'commercial' is not what everyone is doing. It's being an ad for someone else or for a style. Wearing a coofi doesnt make me conscience. Wearing a white-tee doesnt make me a thug. Wearing a suit doesnt make me corporate. When you focus on attire to make your statement of 'who you are', you are 'commercial'. Whether you represent a few or the masses, if your mindset is programmed to believe the clothes make you, then all you are is AN AD THAT PROMOTES A PRODUCT. Now go grab another Qtip so I can clear that left ear.     'The Outside Voice' by Reggie Dinkins, Jr.  Many people often tell us a people dont loud talk, use your inside voice.  This is a good tool to use, especially if you dont want people in your business.  But sometimes that Outside Voice, that hear me, that beer-plated echo in the public bathroom, yeah that is what you need.   Sometimes you need to let the Outside Voice come from within.  Everyone has an inner-nigga, and he should be, he must be heard.  Sometimes he needs to be the main attraction not just the side-bet at the dice game.  If you at the job and somebody is giving you guff, you might need to tell them 'Look here, you better do it, cause James Folkes aint nobodys ho'.   Oh the Outside Voice comes with many smells, tastes and feelings.  The barbershop, the place where you get your fried fish, church, the street, the liquor store.  Many times we as black folk try to be conservative and neglect our Outside Voice, thus keeping him inside.  You cannot keep an Outside creature inside, it will mess up your house, or outgrow your house.  You can keep buying new houses, or just set the lion out back to roam, and be at peace outside.   Sometimes the outside voice comes from outside.  It might be the nigga who pumps your gas giving you 3minutes of wisdom on how your neighborhood is more than it seems.  It might be that old lady in church telling you about these young girls, and how they dont wash their hands.  The Outside Voice should never be kept in the zoo, you just cant cage heeem up, but sometimes he needs a leash.   There are many animals in this so-called civilization that run free, racism, greed, and funk.  You need to let that Outside Voice outside before he eats all your ribs.     For years we as niggas have been instructed to be seen and not heard  to understand but never say a mumbling word.  speak soft and kep our eyes to the curb.  Use your inside voice, that was cracker barrell volume of choice  In this day it is sometimes the outside voice that needs to be heard  The voice of the black masses, the black people's word.  Many people often wonder what guides them  Could it be the voices in their head that leads them  to be mislead or is it the common man under the streetlights so dim.  picking his teeth and counting his bread.  An outside voice might come from many sources,  a wino, the barber, and loud women big as horses,  no need to speak quiet with these powerful outside forces.  Street people talking loud but crackheads dont get divorces,  just smoke real good with no chance of remorses.  Some people say the word on the street aint right,  but if you on Kenilworth go thru stop on red but never for the blue light.    I'm just a nigga in the seatbelt.    Every now and then we might have a special guest on to write. Today is one of those days. Our guest today is gonna give it you from a female's perspective............  'Dream on' by KM  In my lifetime, I’ve made choices. Some good , some bad, but no regrets. Right now I reflect on my short lived years and I am amazed at how many of those choices were influenced by my family’s expectations of me, other people’s opinions of me or my obligation to do just what is right. Getting a good job? Did I really want to work right out of school? Maybe I really just wanted to sit home watching Judge Judy and Oprah for a couple of months, traveling and kicking it with my friends.   For example college. Did I really want to go to college? Was this something I had waited for all my life? Or, was this a choice made for me by my parents years ago? Funny, I never contemplated not going. Still, I did not know what I wanted to study or learn when I got there. Good grades? Did I really care about getting A’s? Or was knowing the consequences behind disappointing the people around me the driving factor in obtaining good grades. I realize that in college I learned, masterfully , how to get by. The information I sometimes read, the papers I wrote, the presentations and other requirements I fulfilled to get the grade. Not to be enlightened. As I think of my motivation now, I am relieved to know that I am finally doing things primarily for the expectations I have set out for myself. Remember back to college, there were so many things we wanted to do. Sports Agent, Media Broadcaster, Advertising Exec…. Travel…. And then… You enter the job market running. We get caught up in the job and our new lifestyles. Let us not forget our dreams, whatever they may be. This time before your next Birthday, reflect on those things, you really want to do or be in life. Start saving NOW, planning NOW and executing NOW to get there. For real, time is flying and there are probably some things you expected to have done by now and where are you in that process? Everyday ask yourself where Do I want to be? Everyday evaluate if what you are doing today is going to help you get there. Because, ultimately where we end up is up to us. Whether we end up locking ourselves into the same everyday job, or go out there and pursue our dreams, time is moving fast. As much as I would like to blame my failures on someone else, I gotta do things for me. Smell me?

455,455,2639424,1,25,"             'Lemme Get a Sheet of Paper'  by Salvador Gabor       Remember that saying.......'Lemme get a sheet of paper?'. We used to say that in school. You'd go to a class that was kinda boring and not care at all. The class wasnt important.......well at least to you it wasnt. The teacher was boring. But, in order to look like you were doing SOMETHING, you'd ask your buddy for a sheet of paper. Who knows what you would do with that sheet. You MIGHT takes notes. You might SEND notes to the pretty girl in class. You might draw your friend's big head on that sheet of paper. Who knows?? But asking for that sheet meant nothing. It was just going to determine how you would spend your next 50 minutes in that boring class.     Well some might say, 'What is the significance of paper?'. Paper is used throughout our society. Money, licenses, contracts, and degrees are ALL important documents on paper. But what is the value of a sheet of paper? Has it gotten to the point where asking for a sheet of paper means doodling on it? Is ONE sheet of paper still valuable in this society?  Lets take some of the examples of paper that we used earlier.   Let's talk about money. Money is a type of paper. But, how valuable is it? My mother once told me 'Being nice can get you places that money cant'. It may seem hard to believe but its true. Money isnt ALWAYS the answer. Me being a black man in America........I am educated, skilled and I'm a great learner. Its very possible that I could become rich and successful. What if I join a country club.......or should I say TRY to join a country club? Does my money make it a sure bet that I'll get in? I would be a First-Generation 'rich man' in my family. My grandfathers weren't rich. My father isn't rich. Some societies and clubs require that your family be drenched in wealth before you can be deemed as fit to enter. Do you think Lebron James or '50 Cent' can just UP and join certain societies? Naw, I dont think so. They both come from the hood and I couldnt see LeBron's mother sipping Tea with no uppidity ladies. I dont see the Augusta Country Club playing 'Go Shawdy' anytime soon. Nor do I see the golfers wearing LeBron James Jerseys while playing 18 holes. Not to say that eventually these two stars wont ease their way in. Their older counterparts, Michael Jordan and 'Jay-Z' have begun to brush shoulders with the big shots. But it isnt JUST the money. They've gained the respect after years of carrying themselves like class acts. You cant just win the lottery coming out of Milwaukee or Detroit in the slums and think that you can go anywhere you want. Un uh, no sir.  That 'paper' dont mean as much as you think.   What about licenses? You might have a driver's license, a gun license or a marriage license. You might have all three. But if you just shot somebody coming from your mistress' house and you get pulled over for speeding, none of those licenses mean anything. You shot somebody. So what that you have a license?? You have a license to carry a gun, not to shoot someone. You were speeding. So what that you have a Driver's license?? You have a license to drive, not to be wreckless. You just came from your mistress' house. So what that you are married?? You didnt think about that license 45 minutes ago.   Let's go onto contracts. A contract is a document with agreements included. Two or more parties come together and agree on the stipulations of the contracts. Their agreement is documented by signatures. You'd think that this is etched in stone right?......uhhh Not quite. Do you know that on some jobs, companies agree to offer you X,Y and Z and at the end of the contract there is a clause. The clause says 'We reserve the right not to fulfill X,Y and Z'. What kinda sense does that make? I sign a contract that says I get X,Y, and Z but, then again the job doesnt have to give me X,Y, and Z??? Houses have contracts too. You sign a mortgage. You pay on that mortgage. You eventually own that house. But if the local government decides to build a stadium on your property, unless you want your living room to be the visitors' locker room......you're gonna have to move. The same idea applies if the city wants to build a subway stop on your property. I'd hate to hear 'Ladies & Gentlemen please refrain from leaning on all doors......Next Stop...Silas' Room........'   What about degrees? Alot of us paid $60,000 for a sheet of paper. Alot of us are STILL paying for that sheet of paper. Some of us went to two or three schools to get that sheet of paper. The ink that it took to write your name on that sheet with the school name and the President's signature is worth about $2. I tell ya, thats some expensive paper. It must be made outta Eqyptian cotton on something. I just wonder sometimes what is this particular paper all about????   My point to all of this is that, the power is in the person, not the paper. That sheet means nothing if I dont have control over the situation. If I have some money and no clout behind it, im just some guy looking to spend money. Ever heard the phrase 'your money's no good here'? Ask that question to some black folks that lived during segregation. Ask a gay person if their marriage license means anything in certain states. Ask a college graduate working at Denny's if their degree means anything.  So I wonder how many of you still put value in a sheet of paper? The powers that be look at your sheet of paper like that kid in the class that bores him. Sometimes I think we waste our time and money buying toilet paper. All the other papers we have seem fit enough to wipe ourselves with. 'Boooooooossssshhhhhhhh'........Oh yeah, dont leave the toilet seat up and for God's sake put the exhaust on!!!!!!!     'Lemme Get a Sheet too' by Reggie Dinkins, Jr  Lemme get a sheet too,  Would you pass the sheet to me,  a piece of top paper so I can twist this doobie.  People feel the need to jot stuff down,  history notes on Board of Education and some dude named Brown.  All the while they write stuff down,  they miss real reason of how it all went down.  Lemme get a piece of paper and I will take you to town,  pick up some eggs some milk, and play my numbers by six.  Matter of fact drop that paper and gimme a stick,  It looks as though I got some gum on my shoe grip.   Lemme get a sheet too,  Wont you gimme just one,  naw I aint concerned about the spiral rippings Ms. Johnson.  Now let me get that piece and I will show you its worth,  I'll rip it and tear it and send it back to the earth,  Why did I do it, well its simple and plain.  If you can do it dont document it, just execute the insane.  Business plans to crazy man bump that just pay me,  A swoosh is just a dinner spoon without the gravy.   Lemme get a sheet too,  Or maybe even two,  I need a receipt for that number you gave me.  Numbers on napkins are worth more than wide-ruled baby.  Wide-ruled means study group, that you wanna borrow my book,  But that there napkin, that is a different sorta look  'call me round ten' tone of voice saying she'll give you the nook.  Napkins can be the basis for a binding contract,  a kinky waitress attracted by your binding contact.  Maybe even a figure that will get you to sign that car contract,  0 down, no monthly payments might find your pockets Koons attracts.   Lemme get a sheet too,  whether its top, or spiral  it's what's on the inside that is what is vital,  tricky words, sticky herbs, or a pill named Midol  The man behind the paper tells the world's survival,  Mr. Xerox or that nigga whose words you quoting  or even that nigga down 58th whose reefer you toking.  Spend less time with sheets, and more with your memory  unless you on the comode the same color as emory.

456,456,2639424,1,25,"             'Ignorant Disdain' by Reggie Dinkins, Jr.  Ignorance is often misinterpreted.  Some people often mistake street-smarts for ignorance, or differing from the status quo as ignorance.  On a serious note there are certain situations when a level of 'ignorance' or ignorant Disdain must be preserved.  Follow me if you will.   Conducting business in the street:  This can also be doing business with street people.  The term street people doesnt necessarily refer to niggas selling drugs, but mainly hustlers in general.  If you are in business for yourself you are a hustler.  You must know how to hustle to get a buck and to avoid being bucked out of a buck.  When conducting business with a street person, there is a certain level of ignorant disdain one must uphold.  For instance if you are flagging a taxi, there is no cute way to do it,  get your butt on the curb and be strong and ignorant, use your best outside voice and get that dimesnatcher's attention.   Lines:  Lines are a primary site for 'social fair projects'  there is always a white woman that will test you.  We were taught as youngsters to wait patiently in line.  Then as we got older we encounter several things that really test this age-old adage.  The DMV oh this requires patience, whether you need your learner's or hard tags, that 'wait patiently' must be on a cigarette break.  Since 'Wait patiently' is on break so am I,  the DMV waits for no man.  Patience might have you back later in the week.  I wanna thank the Brentwood Station aka the Old Levi's BBQ for that drive-thru.   Lines continued:  I previously mentioned white women, sometimes women in general, but mainly white women see fit to challenge a nigga such as myself when they are blatantly wrong.  Now they think just because they have a question, or maybe by some grace of the Magical World of Caucazoids, that we wont see them do this 'I would like to ask a question'.  It is at this point when your ignorance must remain sublime.  If at a department store, kindly hold your desired item in front of the white woman's face aka the Line Stepper and redirect the salesperson (more often is a white woman just as ignorant as the line-stepper, or a minority afraid of what the white person will say).  They ought be afraid of what an 'ignorant' black person will do if you dont acknowledge their 'patient approach'   Mass Transit:  Depending on the day the level of Ignorance on the train/bus can range from moderate to raging.  There are sometimes chicken bones, McDonalds wrappers and all kinds of other things on the bus.  Loud foreigners and teenage urbanites make their pressure felt on train and bus.  I know for myself Wednesdays are always Wild.  Wild Wednesdays, the train always seems to be packed, and someone feels they are so important that they must get on or navigate by any means necessary.  I once had a young girl, around the age of 15 get real ignorant. she thought a flying bump on a crowded train would move me.  Much to her shagrin, there was only one ignorant nigga on the door at the end.

Sexton, Esquire   Ladies, this one is for you. Take notes, this information will be very useful.   Women, ladies, girls, FEED YOUR MEN.  You've have all heard the saying that the way to a man's heart is through his stomach.  THIS IS LAW.  Me personally, I would rather have my lady make me a ham sammich before she gave me some lovin'.  You see ladies, the simple act of making a ham & cheese sammich really shows your man how much you love him.  Combining all those ingredients takes thought and care. The potato bread (either fresh or lightly toasted), the mayonnaise (NOT Miracle Whip), the cheese (Kraft or gubment). A good ham sammich says, 'Baby, I love you.'  And when I finish a good ham sammich I says, 'Man that girl can make a ham sammich, she must her some Gartrelle!'   But it doesn't stop at a ham sammich ladies.  I'm not on some women should be barefoot and pregnant tip, cuz my lady got's to have a J-O-B. Two incomes is a must.  But women's liberation and 'I'm a strong Black independent woman' and all of that don't mean y'all can't cook for us no more.  Y'all still want us to give up our seat, hold the door, change you motor oil, cut the grass, etc. All we ask is that the birth the chirrun and cook up some bacon and cheese eggs sometimes.  Now, I understand that nowadays women got careers and work hard just like us men, but how about cooking a meal just 2-3 times a week? Is that too much to ask? I'm not asking you to cook Thanksgiving dinner, but Hot Pockets and Digiorno Pizza just ain't cutting it any more. We left the Top Ramen behind us in the dorm room.  Maybe it should be the fact that you still love/like us despite our dirty socks on the floor or that ring we leave around the bathtub, or the way you help us out when our funds are low, but the way to prove to a man that you love him is too have some mac n' cheese, some greens and T-bone on the table every now and then.   So to all you new millennium ladies, take notes from your mama's and grandmama's. They know how to make a man feel like a man.  It's a shame that when I go to my lady's mama's house for dinner, her mama has to tell her, 'Girl, you better make that man a plate.'  You see, you young gals don't realize that it doesn't take much to make a man happy.  Give him some lovin' from time to time, let him watch the football game on Sundays in peace, and feed him. It really is as simple as that.  The women of the older generation realized that if you do simple things for us men, you women will get everything you want.  You want a new dress or a new comforter set? Cook your man a hearty meal for a week. You'll be sleeping on 1000 thread count sheets by sunset on Saturday.  You young gals need to take lessons from the older generations. Why you think your grandparents been married for 60 yrs? Because grandpa knew that couldn't nobody put just the right amount of mayo on his ham sammich like your grandma.   Now go on in the kitchen and make your man some scrapple.  Show him how much you care.    and now................   An Announcement from BAULA (Bougie And Uppity Ladies Association)   We, the distinguished ladies of BAULA, are inviting all eligible bachelors to the Annual BAULA 'I Need A Man' Reception and Fundraising Event.   The Purpose of this event is to evaluate all potential marriage prospects.  In addition to your invitation, you will need to bring: a government issued ID, your graduate degree, proof of income, deed to your own house(your mama's house is unacceptable), title to your car (must be luxury), and proof of non-paternity.   We, will be walking around with our noses in the air and will give you an ice grill if you try to approach us before we give you the squirrel-eye.   Refreshments will NOT be served because we don't know how to cook and a caterer cost too much. The new line of Louis Vuitton purses and Jimmy Choo's are coming out next week and those are a must.   BAULA is a FOR Profit organization organized to assist siddity gold diggers in their never ending quest for the sanctity and security of marriage, or at least alimony.

459,459,2639424,1,25,"              Sal's Corner (cont'd) 'BUNK' Part 2    Before you read any further, PLEASE stop. Just stop and if you have a strong imagination I want you to think of a song. How bout..........'The Electric Slide'. YEP that's it. NOW, as you read KEEP that song in your head. Forget the lyrics, they are useless right now. Just, keep the beat in your head. Can you hear that whistle? OK. you hear it too? Aight let's keep it moving.  Now don't lose that beat cause it's what gets us in a 'BUNK' mood. The reason why that song is important is because 'The Electric Slide' was one of my first exposures to the 'BUNK' lifestyle. Your daddy could be on the side eating ribs and chilling. He hears that song and almost spills the whole rib plate on his white linen suit tryna run to that floor. The reaction when that song comes on is unstoppable. Don't bring your caucasion co-worker along to the 'get-to-together'. You tryna act all sophisticated like you don't drink Steel Reserves and nip on a lil Mad Dog. Then THAT song comes on. And you can't help it! That's that 'BUNK' feeling. Now I'm a show yall how to spot a 'BUNK' person...........   * Technology - If your mother and father have cell phones, DVD's, satellite TV and pagers but, don't know how to work em..........YET they know the steps to the 'Electric Slide'.......oh it's some 'BUNK' going on in here.  * Denim - Too much Denim can get nasty. You, your wife AND your son JT at the concert with Jean Outfits on is NOT cool. That's that 'BUNK'.  * Adding the letter 'S' to words - For those of you who live near D.C., don't you just wanna scream when that old lady says 'YEAH I been to DreamSSSS'? The place is called 'DREAM' not 'DreamS'!. 'Tell Gloria to pick me up a carton of Milk from the SafewayS'. The grocery store is call Safeway. There is NO 'S' at the end. Or what about this.......'Those are some nice Gentlemens over there for you Retha'. You betta hope that Retha doesn't walk up to one of them men talking all 'BUNK' like that. Gentlemen is plural, no need for an 'S'.  * Adding the letter 'R' to words - Now 'BUNK' people TRY to be sophisticated SOME of the time. They might get up in Red Lobster and say.......'I think I'll take a SODER'. 'BUNK' people have been 'BUNK' so long that they don't think that proper pronounciations of words may end in vowels. In the example, they may use 'SODER' but, they are tryna say 'SODA'. Or they might go to a furniture store and say 'I'm looking for a burgundy SOFER'. It's SOFA.   Sidenote: Now if you haven't heard any of these examples then you aint been exposed to 'BUNK'. For those who are and have been exposed, turn that radio up in your mind. Can you still hear the 'Electric Slide'?   * Eating while out of town - If you eat Off-Brand Honey Buns, Liver Pudding, Pork Rinds, and or sit in the open area of the double-doors of your van while eat cheese sandwiches.............your are definitely 'BUNK'.  * House Attire - Gowns, nighties and robes are to be worn before 10:00 A.M. and After 9:30 P.M.. Anything between those hours can be grounds for being seen as being 'BUNK'. Now grandmothers, women over 60 and pregnant women are an exception.   * Basement - If you still have that 'red light' by the defunct bar in your basement you are 'BUNK'. And it wouldnt't hurt to take those Rick James posters down either.   * Crossed Legs - 'BUNK' women don't cross their legs. Most of em say 'Shoot Im 65 years old. Whoever wanna see my stuff is just gonna have to see it cause my leg is too sore to be lifting over top of the other'.    Ya know........I had many examples of 'BUNK' behavior but, I can't do a 'BUNK' Part 12!!! I just can't. We'll be here for years. But, just read over parts 1 and 2 and if you see any questionable 'BUNK' behavior, feel free to email me. If you have any stories of 'BUNK' people, I'd be happy to listen to them. I'm always ready and eager to hear about my 'BUNK' people. Yes.....MY people. Deep down I too am 'BUNK'. But, I strategize my 'BUNKness'. We all need it from time to time. Just don't overuse it. 'Lord Willin, Rome Feelin'.       People to Stay Away From (for the month of July)  By Reggie Dinkins, Jr.      As the weather gets warmer, it makes the weird niggas swarm. Folks get crazy and tend to stray way away from the norm. Now we as people know there are certain things that we ought to stay away from, like fatty foods, fat people in tight spaces, and doughnuts with flies in the doughnut case.   People in Flannel: Now it is July and unless you work construction there is no reason that you should be wearing flannel, unless you are over on Walker Mill for the Lumberjack Games on July 32nd. People who are wearing flannel, for non construction/lumberjack reasons, are interestingly dangerous. They are wearing those outfits because they are stuck in a number of time warps, i.e. the mid 80's and early 90's, or because it is suitable front porch attire and because it is a perfect beer-drinking outfit. Nonetheless, you don't want ole Dempsey to come down off that porch.   People with Overly Visible Baby Powder: Now these people tend to be dark niggas over 40, and busty older women.  These older males tend to have a t-shirts with cut-off sleeves, and are usually wearing walkmen, which in itself is dangerous. Niggas over 40 should not have walkmen. They could listening to anything from Trouble Funk to Air Raid or The Temptations. Busty older women with powder on their cleavage. This is a very disturbing because you know Ms. Moore is wearing that v-cut turtle-neck because it is Tuesday and then she goes and dumps what appears to be Bisquick all in she shirt. Now she looks like a mother panda ready to nurse Janitor Mixon, who can't get enough of Ms. Moore. Oh I can't forget about my big guys. Big dudes love that baby powder, but I can't blame Big Kevin for trying to stay cool. Not to mention that if Kevin's second layer of self between his neck and hip heats up, we could all be in for a world of trouble.   People with 2 Ice Cream Cones: Now this could be a ploy.  Sometimes you are places and they give away free ice cream, and Brenda is acting like she is taking it to Sharon.  Needless to say, she is just trying to looking cute with those 2 cones, because she is working hard to seduce Janitor Mixon.   That Nigga with the Crabmeat on His Bottom Lip: Oh you know this guy. If he aint your uncle, he treats you like he is your uncle, or like you are his. He either makes sure you got a beer, or makes a meek face at you when you notice he is on Michelob number 8.  This guy sits down and says 'oh let me get in this bushel'. He is eating crabs early, and that is when crabmeat first meets him. So you notice it, and you are thinking 'it comes with the territory', but, 2 beers 12 crabs, and a plate of ribs chicken, potato salad and cole slaw, and it is still just hanging out on his lip. Lodell is in on every conversation, from Redskins-Cowboys talk, to Kobe, and is even showing a pretty girl how to eat crabs. Oh the crabmeat does disappear on the 10th beer, but guess what, it comes right back on Lodell's last long sip. Ladies watch out, he is the nigga that hugs you too tight at family/non-family functions.    'A word to the wino should suffice. If you drink to get drunk, then drunk you will be long after the drink has been drunk.'  --Lodell Thomas, Minority Shareowner (see Consumation Act of LSE '99) of Bass Liquors--

466,466,2639424,1,25,"             'A Ghetto Vet' by Reggie Dinkins, Jr.  Today's focus is on a nigga for sure.  As a servant to his community and his country, Duffy Rollark embodies the the term 'Ghetto Veteran'. Rollark often refered to as 'Sarge', leaving one to think he was a Sargeant in the Army, but he wears a Marines jacket with Lieutenant embroidered and 'Rollark'.  However, it is known that Duffy fought in Vietnam at the Chateau Brióne in Vietnam circa '1974.   Sarge is a pillar of his community.  He can be found strolling Minnesota Ave during the day, and patrolling it's alleyways at night.  A Ghetto Vet in every sense of the word, Rollark, knew where all the 'fox-holes', muddy-spots, and herbal terrain, spanning a 5-mile radius.  It was a known alley-folklore that Sarge killed 5 Charlie's with his bear-hands while at the Chateau Brióne.  It was also known that the nigga had been hit in the head prior to and during his stint in Vietnam.   Sarge continued his military tactics when he returned from Vietnam in '85.  Now we know the war was well over by that time, but it is said that Sarge vacationed for a few years after it was all over.  Rollark would often black his face to go and buy 'medicine' for his chronic case of jungle.  He once scared the 2-time Hustler of the Week (August '94, and May '96) Jermaine Cheaney, one Thursday evening.  Rollark jumped out the bush and rolled over a parked car with his 12 gauge cradled, and kindly asked Cheaney for a 50-sack.  Needless to say this left Cheaney a bit shellshocked, and was later quoted on Benning Road 'man I thought it was the Abominable Nigga that killed them people up the Langston, man I liked to got teary-eyed'.   Sarge once led a Re-con mission to Aquatic Gardens, because he overheard a buddy of his placing a carryout order to a friend's house on Quarles Street.  Duffy Rollark went unseen in a snorkel, black face paint, and some cut-up jean shorts, toting his gauge down to Aquatic Gardens.  A man of few words, Duffy was heard mumbling this in between Mayfair and Paradise.. 'them gooks keep marchin tru my hood hoorah hoorah, them gooks keep marchin tru my hood, im gonna dance on their face and piss down they chimmney, is that you Colonel....' Duffy Rollark a Ghetto Vet.    Announcement: I (Reggie Dinkins, Jr) will be down Hooters today between 4:41 and 4:53 giving free mammagrams, no underwires allowed, all participants receive a cup of water upon my completion.     Commentary by Salvador Gabor   I went to a few malls/shopping districts in the D.C. Area on Saturday. I went down to Georgetown, Pentagon City and Prince George's Mall. For all intents and purposes, these 3 shopping areas may attract the highest volume of shoppers in the D.C. Area. It's funny how during the rain, sleet, snow or sunshine we all go out and spend that money! Its not JUST a black thing either! EVERYONE was out. Suits, furniture, shoes......I mean whatever was being sold, people were buying it. I myself spent $100 in about 20 minutes. When I go shopping, I know what I want, get what I want and I get outta there!   But I began to think........all these stores, all these malls, all these things.......are at the palm of our hands, but what good are they? I saw a plasma TV for $19,500!!!!!!!! Believe me, this was the best TV I'd ever seen but $20 G's!!! I just wondered for a second, why are there no stock stores in the mall? Why are there no mutual funds stores in the mall? Why arent there any investment stores in the mall? I came up with an answer that I've known deep down for years but we all have to come to grips with........the things that are best for us will not be handed to us. They will not be clearly visible. The phrase 'The Revolution will not be televised' became very clear to me in a mall on a saturday afternoon.  Going to the mall is cool. Having clothes and luxurious things are cool but that little $100 I spent could have gotten me some investments had I seen a Stocks & Bonds store in the mall before I got to the GAP. It's crazy where your money goes sometimes. I was in the barber shop and a guy said 'It's getting to the point where when I walk out the house, Im GONNA spend $100'. I was once told 'If you break a $100 Bill, you might as well forget about that $100'. The things we spend money on are just ridiculous. One minute the money is here and the next minute it is gone!   Let's talk about things not clearly being visible. Have you ever watched a commercial or had a friend in some system/pyramid, or got some pop up mail/spam about becoming an 'overnight millionaire'? You ever wondered, 'why does this person wanna show ME how to be a millionaire'? More than likely, its too good to be true. Honestly, you're not gonna find many people just out here willing to show you how to be financially free without a serious cost! Most people keep the good stuff to themselves. If your friend buys some new shoes that no one has ever seen before, he or she is NOT GONNA TELL YOU, so how does it look for a STRANGER to tell you how to be a MILLIONAIRE?!?!?! Go to a book store, the magazines about cars, women, music and fashion are in the front..........the investment books, books on health, spirituality, and better living are towards the back. Another example.......I know people who dont have jobs. Some of these people often ask me to 'find them a job'. And I look in the papers and other avenues that provide job searching but it comes down to one thing.......a closed mouth dont get fed. When you are hungry, you ask for food. You dont get someone else to ask for you. People like that dont last in this world. The same way you beg for change YOURSELF, you gotta look for a job YOURSELF. You dont ask another bum to collect change for you. The same way you sell drugs YOURSELF, you find a job YOURSELF. You dont stand outside with another guy and stand there while he sells your drugs. The same way you sit in the house all day and make an effort to do nothing, you gotta take that same effort and DO SOMETHING. Whatever you are doing wrong, you make an effort to do so. Take that energy and reverse it. But you gotta be able to think around just doing the obvious. Doing a job search JUST on the internet wont cut it baby! EVERYBODY goes on the net to job hunt, so you applying against thousands of people. You betta walk the streets, pick up a journal or local paper and go the alternate way!  The whole point of this matter is not to be drawn to the distractions. They are prevalent and at the palm of your hands. They are easily accessible and can easily keep you on the ground. Look beyond the obvious. No matter if its looking for a job, looking for a 'come-up', or looking for a good way to spend $100. No one is gonna hand something to you and its not gonna fall in your lap.           ",5309,1000,A Ghetto Vet by Reggie Dinkins Jr Today's focus is on a nigga for sure As a servant to his community and his country Duffy Rollark embodies the the term Ghetto Veteran Rollark often refered to as Sarge leaving one to think he was a Sargeant in the Army but he wears a Marines jacket with Lieutenant embroidered and Rollark However it is known that Duffy fought in Vietnam at the Chateau Brióne in Vietnam circa Sarge is a pillar of his community He can be found strolling Minnesota Ave during the day and patrolling it's alleyways at night A Ghetto Vet in every sense of the word Rollark knew where all the fox-holes muddy-spots and herbal terrain spanning a mile radius It was a known alley-folklore that Sarge killed Charlie's with his bear-hands while at the Chateau Brióne It was also known that the nigga had been hit in the head prior to and during his stint in Vietnam Sarge continued his military tactics when he returned from Vietnam in Now we know the war was well over by that time but it is said that Sarge vacationed for a few years after it was all over Rollark would often black his face to go and buy medicine for his chronic case of jungle He once scared the time Hustler of the Week August and May Jermaine Cheaney one Thursday evening Rollark jumped out the bush and rolled over a parked car with his gauge cradled and kindly asked Cheaney for a sack Needless to say this left Cheaney a bit shellshocked and was later quoted on Benning Road man I thought it was the Abominable Nigga that killed them people up the Langston man I liked to got teary-eyed Sarge once led a Re-con mission to Aquatic Gardens because he overheard a buddy of his placing a carryout order to a friend's house on Quarles Street Duffy Rollark went unseen in a snorkel black face paint and some cut-up jean shorts toting his gauge down to Aquatic Gardens A man of few words Duffy was heard mumbling this in between Mayfair and Paradise them gooks keep marchin tru my hood hoorah hoorah them gooks keep marchin tru my hood im gonna dance on their face and piss down they chimmney is that you Colonel Duffy Rollark a Ghetto Vet Announcement I Reggie Dinkins Jr will be down Hooters today between and giving free mammagrams no underwires allowed all participants receive a cup of water upon my completion Commentary by Salvador Gabor I went to a few malls/shopping districts in the D.C Area on Saturday I went down to Georgetown Pentagon City and Prince George's Mall For all intents and purposes these shopping areas may attract the highest volume of shoppers in the D.C Area It's funny how during the rain sleet snow or sunshine we all go out and spend that money Its not JUST a black thing either EVERYONE was out Suits furniture shoes......I mean whatever was being sold people were buying it I myself spent in about minutes When I go shopping I know what I want get what I want and I get outta there But I began to think........all these stores all these malls all these things.......are at the palm of our hands but what good are they I saw a plasma TV for Believe me this was the best TV I'd ever seen but G's I just wondered for a second why are there no stock stores in the mall Why are there no mutual funds stores in the mall Why arent there any investment stores in the mall I came up with an answer that I've known deep down for years but we all have to come to grips with........the things that are best for us will not be handed to us They will not be clearly visible The phrase The Revolution will not be televised became very clear to me in a mall on a saturday afternoon Going to the mall is cool Having clothes and luxurious things are cool but that little I spent could have gotten me some investments had I seen a Stocks Bonds store in the mall before I got to the GAP It's crazy where your money goes sometimes I was in the barber shop and a guy said It's getting to the point where when I walk out the house Im GONNA spend I was once told If you break a Bill you might as well forget about that The things we spend money on are just ridiculous One minute the money is here and the next minute it is gone Let's talk about things not clearly being visible Have you ever watched a commercial or had a friend in some system/pyramid or got some pop up mail/spam about becoming an overnight millionaire You ever wondered why does this person wanna show ME how to be a millionaire More than likely its too good to be true Honestly you're not gonna find many people just out here willing to show you how to be financially free without a serious cost Most people keep the good stuff to themselves If your friend buys some new shoes that no one has ever seen before he or she is NOT GONNA TELL YOU so how does it look for a STRANGER to tell you how to be a MILLIONAIRE Go to a book store the magazines about cars women music and fashion are in the front..........the investment books books on health spirituality and better living are towards the back Another example.......I know people who dont have jobs Some of these people often ask me to find them a job And I look in the papers and other avenues that provide job searching but it comes

467,467,2639424,1,25,"             Sal's Corner 'Africans'    First off, I am not a racist, prejudiced or any of those things. Im just the dude who tells it how YOU see it. But you either cant put it into words or you're scared to do so. But let me say that Africans are one of the funniest groups of people in the world. I love Africans. I love their style, flash and confidence. They are true black people. Not tainted with several races but true original blacks from Africa. I watch and observe them. Here are some of the things I have seen:   * Misconception: 'Africans are smarter than everyone else'. One word, Two syllables: HOGWASH! Let me tell you something. And this goes for any other foreign people who come to this land..........if you come across the world to be here, when you get here, you are not gonna be BS'n. All Africans arent smarter than us, they just left the dumb ones IN Africa. If I was African, and I had 2 sons, one was dumb and the other was smart, the SMART one could go to college in America but the dumb one would be at Timbuktu Community College! If you went to China, you wouldnt go over there to make $30,000/year. You can do that HERE!  * Attire: Africans are hit or miss people. Either they were NICE clothing. Such as Prada, Ralph Lauren, Lacoste, Ferragamo etc etc or they were Yellow Jeans and sandles. Aint too many 'White-Tee' type people. If they are gonna get fly, THEY GET FLY, if not its 'CROSS COLOURS' galore  * Hygiene: All Africans dont stink. NOPE, its just that the ones that do stink, they smell so bad that you think they all stink.   * Vehicle: Come on NOW! a 1986 560 SEL...........THATS ALL they are pushing. Yall know what im talking about...........do I gotta show yall!!!!     * Foul Language: Its is FUNNY to hear an African curse! Curse word of Choose: MUTHAF*&^%. They use that one very much so! Sometimes they say Nigga (Which is not a curse word) but its just funny when they say it. It comes out like (NEEGA!)  * UnderCover Africans: Yaaah yall thought I aint know. Some of yall are African and dont lead on to it. No accent or nothing. Name might even be regular. But when your parents come up to the school with that short sleeve party shirt, green slacks and them extra shiny gold watches we KNOW. Only Africans and Pimps on their days off dress like that.   * Jewelry. Look for the GOLD. Niggas wear platinum, Africans wear gold! Always remember that.  * Confidence: Africans display a serious amount of confidence. Go to the DMV. You and your buddy are scared you wont get your license renewed cause you might have tickets owed. But that fella over there in the Kente cloth, HE's determined to be in and out in 15 minutes. He dont even stand in LINE! 'Who am I to stand in a line!'  * Names: Africans and their names can be wild. Sometimes the name denotes their African Heritage and sometimes it dont. You might run into a BABATUNDE MCGLOVER and be thrown off. Cause his parents coulda been high and off some black power tip and named him Babatunde OR he could be African and someway or another his family ended up as the McGlover's.  * Men: The thing that stands out the most about Africans is how they raise their young men. You dont see African women raising kids by themselves, you see that father in the family life. When you see an African family together, you can sense the strength of the father figure when they walk in the room. I've seen many documentaries about the rites of passage for several tribes and sects on the continent of Africa and their young men are prepared for life at an early age.    All in all, I love my African people. I love their attire, their music and how they may not know much English..........but if someone says '50 Cent' or '2PAC' THEY GO WILD! Next Week People.......'Lord Willin, Rome Feelin'     Verbal Prohibitions by Reggie Dinkins, Jr.  There are many words throughout the English language that have stronger meanigs to some people, and may frequent conversation more than others.  However some people should be prohibited from saying certain words.  Today I am looking at the Big folks.  Some people may say, hey big people catch a lot of flack, but there are certain things they should not say.  I myself try to stay away from awkward situations for myself and the other situatee.  Follow me, you shouldnt need your flashlight, but I will leave some bread crumbs.   Catapult:  Big people should never use this word.  Just say the nigga flew over the wall.  Aint nobody catapulting no 234 pound woman, not Robin Hood, not NASA, not King Kong.   Hammock:  Big people please no talk of buying hammocks, laying in hammocks, or even thinking about hammocks.  If you have been in a hammock keep it to yourself, there is no point in buying that much rope to take a nap outdoors.  If any of you plus-sizes people got a hammock, put a box-spring under him, because I know you laying low.   Snack: This is one of those words that sounds funny coming out a big girl's mouth. 'think I'll have me a snack'  I think you better get some water, because you just had lunch Keeda.  Sat down and chill out, you still smell like them turkey wings from 20mins ago.   'No more...that's too much':  This is a phrase heard in places like Baskin Robbins, or your local carry-out.  More often than not, you aint hungry big folks, you just in there because of a hard burp.  You tasted that Manwich in the burp and now you think you hungry.  Just because they have sprinkles at Baskin Robbins doesnt mean you need them, probablly just came out of Giant with a bag of Milanos (Pepperidge Farms cookies) and gonna crush them on that big sundae.   'With his big self':  unless you follow this with 'I know I am big but' please refrain from saying it.   'Think I'lll have..':  this is usually followed by something gargantaur, like a triple-cheese burger, or something fit for a grown man. Dont no man want a woman who eats as much as him (in one sitting)   'Uhm that looks good': I dont even want to get into this.  Needless to say it is said to often.  Keeda dont touch my food.   '...cakes':  Big people should not say cakes, treats or snacks   'Can I have a bite':  No not that walrus sized bite you bout to take.  dont do it, please dont do it, if I catch you I'm gonna tell it.   'Just a taste': Big people you aint tasting nothing, quit it.   Adjectives:  Big people keep those adjectives simple, when you start saying delectible and scrumptious, I have a problem with that.  You just greedy, it dont taste that good.   I wouldnt want you to think I am picking on the chunky  There is just no need to act a monkey  Over food, females just no need to act funky.  Remember that when at Golden Corral,  Or at Duff's before eating the whole cow.  Watch your carbs, and your fat intake,  Because nobody wants to be wedged on the train next to a human buttercake.

477,477,2639424,1,25,"              'Sample Clearance'  By Gartrelle W. Sexton, Esq.    You brothers need to get your samples cleared before you start using what somebody else did before. You are probably asking yourself 'What in the world is Gartrelle talking about'?  Well I'm talking about the 'Button-Up' craze/phenomenon that has invaded the closets of young brothers everywhere.   'I don't wear jerseys, I'm thirty plus/Get a crisp pair of jeans nigga button up.' And with that line, Shawn Corey Carter once again dictated YOUR wardrobe.   Ya know, I'm glad that brother's have somewhat slowed down with the wearing of the 'throwbacks' because at least it doesn't look like an NBA All-Star game is about to break-out on every corner. But now everybody looks like that BIG colorful lollipop you get at Kings Dominion.   You can't go out nowadays without seeing brothers in a butto...(Wait a minute, I refuse to call a basic SHIRT, a button-up anymore. It's just a shirt. AND like my colleague Reggie Dinkins, Jr. has said, it really is a button-DOWN. I start from the top and work my way down when I put on my 16 1/2 [that's the measurement of your neck-size for all of you who don't know how to buy a shirt that FITS.  XXL, XXXL are not sizes for real shirts.] But I digress)   I was recently out and about and out of say 30 dudes, about 21 had on striped SHIRTS. What happened to originality? Dudes can't think for themselves anymore? I mean I saw two guys together both wearing similar shirts.  What's worse is that one actually had on a blue Yankee fitted cap.  I said to myself, 'What a tool.'  Niggas will wear whatever ever you tell them to wear if you tell them the right way.  Niggas would start wearing trash bags if a rapper could make it rhyme. He could say something like: 'I'm dressed so fresh all you niggas is mad/Button ups is for fags/I rock a Glad trash bag.'  Next thing you know niggas would stop wearing 'button ups' and would be buying designer trash bags at Shopper's Food Warehouse.   And the cufflinks. Niggas that don't even own suits are wearing cufflinks now. A shirt, some jeans, some tennis shoes, and cufflinks. Stop it! Cufflinks are to be worn with a French cuffed shirt, a suit, and some HARD bottom shoes.  Now I've always been one to go against the grain and ignore the brainwashing of the 'the white man,' so wearing clothes in an unconventional manner is cool with me.  But think about it gentlemen, when this 'style' fades away, you will look back and realize how foolish you looked wearing cufflinks without a suit and tie.   What also upsets me is that I will not wear my shirts with jeans as often now because I don't want to look like every one else.  I have worn shirts for years, colorful striped ones, plain basic ones, etc. (I never wore cufflinks though unless I had on a suit.)  Since I'm not a follower, and I don't like to dress exactly like everyone else, I'm putting my shirts on the backburner for a while.  But I still do me, without looking like everybody else, because even though I took the time to write this, I really don't care what any of y'all wear. I'm just trying to enlighten some of you.  So fellas, stop sampling and start creating your own style, then maybe, just maybe, you can be as cool as me.

(Creating Leisure Outfits Now Everyone's the Same)     'True Courage' by Salvador Gabor   A few days ago a man named Pat Tillman died. Yes, people die everyday. At first sight, this seems like a regular death but, it's not. Pat Tillman was a football player for the Arizona Cardinals. Even though he wasn't extremely known, his presence will be missed. Now Tillman didn't die on a football field, he died in the act of war. He died while serving in Afghanistan. Tillman gave up his football career for a career in the military. He wanted to join his brother in active duty for the United States. Tillman was far from some bum who didn't have a shot at playing time. Pat Tillman turned down $3,600,000 from the Cardinals to go to serve his country. How many of us would do that?  I feel for the Tillman family. Most people would say 'Awww they gonna be aight. They have money'. But, it's obvious that money isn't the determining factor to the Tillman's. This is a man who gave up his possessions and fame for what he believed in. Now many of us are skeptical over the war but, that's beside the point. He chose a path and was not lead by his own wants. He felt that he had a mission to carry out. People lose focus and scan in on the fact that he died but, he is leaving a legacy. He makes the soldiers in Iraq know that no matter if the war is right or wrong, they have a reason to be proud. They chose this life and no matter what decisions come down from the Government, they are ready to follow suit.  Normally, I don't get THIS serious but, what are you willing to die for? Tillman took the saying 'Stand for nothing and you'll fall for anything' to another level. he gave up $3.6 Million for the sake of serving the U.S.. Now, I dont care what any of you all say. If I had to give up a few 'meeyons' to serve yall............cancel that.....quickly! I send out my condolences to the Tillman family and the other fallen soldiers and their respective families. We have men dying over debts, drugs, and 'respect' in this country. These guys who die over insignificant things are dying for NO reason and a soldier gives up his life for another man to able to sleep with no fear. It's something to think about. But, what are you willing to die for?    'Word of the Day' by Reggie Dinkins, Jr.   quixotic  \kwik-SOT-ik\, adjective 1.

484,484,2822042,0,47,"       Seduced By An Entity Ch. 25 by Erotica_Writings © Selena the witch of seduction would hunt out married men who normally would never think of betraying their wives, the thought of adultery was distasteful to them. She was out to destroy any true love since she was thrown away by a mortal man she fell in love with centuries ago. She was going to make all the mortal men pay dearly for her pain. Once she seduced him with her spell of lust she would make sure their wives discovered their affair, most of the time catching them in the act. Selena would make him become obsessed with her being oblivious to his wife, even when his wife caught him making illicit love to Selena he was blinded by the witches spell. She would arrange the killing of their wives so he had the guilt of destroying the only woman he had ever loved now forever gone, along with the spell she cast on him of lust. Left only with the knowledge of her death, the adultery he had committed. This would cause him to go totally insane. She was beautiful, she had long red hair, her eyes were blue, and she wore clothing that fit tight on her perfect hour glass figure revealing her large bust. She walked down the side walk hunting for a husband to destroy when she saw a husband and wife kissing each other good bye in front of a real estate office he worked at. Smiling for she could feel the love between them, she decided she needed a house. Walking inside wearing tight white pants, a white shirt that fit tight with a very low cut neck line revealing, with white spiked heals. Smiling she walked up to him noticing that his eyes was on her breast as her nipples could be seen under the shirt since she was braless.  Sounding very seductive touching his brown tie and smiling.' I am interested in a really large house. Do you have a large one I might enjoy?' she asked smiling at him seductively her red lips looked wet.  'Yes, I do have a large one, a large house I mean that you might enjoy.' He told her.' we can go see it now if you like?' He asked her not being able to take his eyes off her body.  'Well then lets go.' she told him smiling taking his arm into hers making it easier to glance down her top which he did feeling an urge coming over him.  Once in the car she leaned close to him as he was driving her breast rubbed against his arm, touching his leg with her hand and running her long red nails up his thigh making it quite known she was coming onto him. Inside the house she walked in front of him knowing he would not be able to help noticing how perfectly round her ass was. She walked next to him when faked tripping knowing he would grab her in his arms; she looked up at him casting her finale spell of seduction through her eyes.  He was tall with black hair, stocky built, he wore a cream color dress shirt, brown dress slacks and dark brown dress shoes, his eyes a light green. He moved his hand under her shirt yearning to touch her breast bringing her mouth up to his, he began kissing her passionately, and he never felt a kiss like this before. He slowly undressed her looking at her perfect body. He disrobed and took down to the floor as they pleasured each other with the fire growing inside of their bodies and her spell on him becoming stronger over him. Not once did his wife cross his mind while he was with this seductive witch. After they reached their climax of the lustful passion he laid there, the guilt started to take over his conscious for the betrayal to his one true love.  'We better go now.' He said dressing quickly.  She smiled feeling his pain was just beginning.' sure, when are we going to see each other again?' she asked him smiling.  'We're not.' He told her avoiding her eyes.  'What you fuck me? And dump me?' she asked angrily.  'I am married to a wonderful woman! Hell I don't even know your name!' he yelled at her for being angry with him self for giving into cheap lust.  'Did you forget you were married when you put your hand under my shirt?!' she asked him yelling as if she was the innocent victim.  'I apologize for that. I have never been with another woman in twenty years except for my wife.' He told her feeling bad now that she thought he used her.  'Well my name is Selena and you are?' she asked still acting like she had been used.  What could it hurt to tell her my name? He thought to himself. 'I am John Phillips and I feel really bad about what just happened here between us.' He told her hoping it would help her not to feel so bad.  'Oh I see I am not good enough. I suppose you have others who are!' she told him looking angry.  'There were never any others except for you.' He told her trying to make her feel better, but it seemed anything he said just made it worse.  'Just take me back to the office please.' She said making tears appear in her eyes making him feel even worse.  On the way back to the office she sat crying. Knowing he felt like the dirt she wanted him to feel like. 'I am surprised you didn't ask me how much I charged!' she told him crying even harder.  'I didn't think you were a prostitute Selena. 'He told her as he drove the car.  'Just a common whore that's all!' she said really playing the tear scene.  'I am so sorry for what I did to you.' He said feeling guiltier.  As they were getting out of the car she looked at him.' Just remember every time you fuck your wife she is fucking me too!' she told him walking down the side walk.  That night when his wife met him at home he felt guilty for having sex with Selena. When he kissed her hello it was different now that another woman's lips touched his, there wasn't that feeling he felt with Selena. That night as he lay in bed with his wife, Selena cast a spell for him to feel the lust again as he did earlier in the day as he remembered the wild passionate sex with her. He became aroused thinking of her large breast and the sweet taste of her hardened nipples as he slowly licked them hearing her low moans, the way her body moved on top of his. He started to kiss his wife thinking of Selena, he ran his hands over her body, but it was not like Selena's with large firm breast, Brenda had small breast. Closing his eyes he asked his wife to get on top of him recreating the sex with Selena moving in a circular slow motion teasing him until he was in the fantasy with Selena forgetting it was his wife that he exploded in such a powerful orgasm.' Se-Lena! 'He screamed out her name exploding in such a fiery passion.  His wife's eyes held the hurt and betrayal as he looked into them. She jumped off the bed.  ' who the fuck is Selena?' she asked standing in the middle of the room naked as he looked at her small framed body, her short brown hair.  'No one my brown eyed girl.' He told her trying to smile as he realized he really screwed it up this time.  'You called me Selena! Where did the name come from then?' she asked him as tears ran down her face.  'I said Brenda.' He told her trying to cover the best he could.  'Are you trying to tell me I am crazy? That I imagined hearing you call me Selena?' she asked as she pulled on her jeans and sweat shirt.  'No baby, but I don't know a Selena.' He lied knowing the truth would end their marriage of twenty years.' please come back to bed, if I said it I don't know why I would say it.' He lied again trying to get her calmed down  she looked at him suspiciously as she undressed putting her gown back on, she got back in bed turning her back to him falling a sleep. Selena crept into his dreams floating into the room in a long red sheer night gown, her hair flowing as she floated in caressing her breast, as he dreamed she masturbated calling his name.' John, oh John.' He dreamt her pulling back the covers as she began to give him oral sex. He could feel her moist mouth with those wet red lips on his hard organ as his hands were going through her long red hair , his body moving in his sleep, the orgasm felt so real, saying her name in his sleep as he exploded in a massive orgasm waking up calling out her name. He realized his wife had left.  after watching her husband dream of this Selena having sex with her , watching his body move, his hands moving as if they were running through her hair . She knew by his motions he must have been dreaming of her giving him oral sex. She got up quietly slipping out of the house, driving off in her car crying that her husband was being unfaithful to her. She checked into a motel room where he would not be able to find her.  John pulled on his pants to search the house for his wife finding her car gone, he knew she had left. He drove the streets searching for her but she wasn't at any of her friends or families house when he saw Selena walking down the street in a very short red dress with matching spiked heels, he came to a screeching stop, he felt anger towards her as he jumped out of the car he ran up to her grabbing her by both of her arms he began to yell at her.' You're ruining my marriage! Why won't you leave me alone!' he yelled as he looked at her face full of fear.  'I haven't done anything! I was walking down the street minding my own business when you grabbed me!' she told him as he had her body pressed up against his.  'My wife left because I called out your name having sex with her thinking of you! Because I dreamt of you giving me oral sex.' He said calming down realizing she must think he was crazy.  'So it's my fault that you seduced me in an empty house? It's my fault that you desired me and fantasized that it was me you were making love to? plus it is my fault that you dreamt of me giving you oral sex to pleasure, you?' she asked him as he was holding her tighter to his body his breathing becoming heavy with desire for her.  'I can't stop wanting you.' He told her kissing her passionately running his hand under her dress finding she was not wearing anything under the dress. He licked her breast pushing her up against the car. 'I want you damn it.' He told her taking her right there up against the car as people drove by watching the sex show until he exploded inside of her. He could not get enough of her and he decided to take her to his house.  He carried her up stairs into the bed he shared with his wife making love to her caressing her breast as they moved together, she rolled him over. 'Let me make your dream come true.' she said going down on him until he called out her name so loud it could be heard through out the neighborhood. She continued to perform oral sex so she could make him become aroused again so she could ride him slowly feeling his hands over her entire body until they exploded together in a massive orgasm. Feeling she had him under her spell completely there was no returning from the hell she had created for him. she sat across his chest with her hand between her thighs moving her hips in a up and down motion pleasuring herself when he could no longer stand to watch it for she was driving his lust far out of control he pulled her closer pleasuring her with oral sex something he would never do with his wife. He made love to her the entire night until the sun came up.  'This is the kind of sex you only read about.' he told her kissing her with his hand on the back of her head.  'I better go now.' She told him kissing him good bye as she made sure she left enough of her long red hair around the house for his wife to find.  That night Brenda came home to find he was in bed where his thoughts were not of her, but of Selena, he was sexually aroused and wanting release of his sexual frustration. Brenda sat on the bed to talk to him when she saw the long red hair.' I suppose this is my imagination too?' she asked angrily, but before she could get off the bed he had a dead grip on her arm.  He looked possessed as his eyes were glazed his teeth were clenched together as he spoke to her. 'No it's not your fucking imagination! She was here all night pleasing me, something you have no knowledge of because you just lay there on your back! Well I want her again!' he told his wife ripping her clothes off of her, closing his eyes he thought of his beautiful Selena while he was raping his wife Brenda and calling her Selena. His kisses were passionate, his hands roaming her body as he became more violent.' Suck me like Selena does!' he ordered her. He was half crazed out of his mind.  'No I will not!' she yelled at him struggling to get away from him.  John became enraged throwing her on her stomach raping her anally, not hearing his wife's screams, but only Selena's moans. 'Selena I want you, I love you!' he cried as he had an orgasm.  Selena came walking into the room as John forced Brenda to stay as Selena joined them forcing the woman to watch her pleasure her husband orally as he held Brenda's wrist so she could not get away. She cried hysterically for she no longer knew her husband.  'I want your wife too.' She said forcing her kisses on her mouth, this excited John even more watching her fondle his wife's breast, kissing and licking them. She made him force her to perform oral on her by beating her until she gave into his commands; he lay next to them touching Selena. Telling her how much he loved her and would do anything for her. They both raped her all night, her cries and pleads went UN heard by her husband as they were pleasuring themselves sadistically. He threw Brenda on the bed where he began raping her as he strangled her to death. Brenda laid dead in their bed, the spell of Selena was gone, as well as Selena. It was as if she never existed while his wife laid there bloodied from the brutal beating she received and the last words she heard spoken and took with her in death was I love you Selena. He had his wife's blood all over his naked body as he cried out a horrifying scream from what he had done to her. He literally went crazy sitting his wife up in the bed as if they were carrying on a conversation.  'I think we should both stay home from work today.' He told his wife's corpse. 'Good I am glad you agree with me.' He told her kissing her bloodied and bruised mouth.  They remained in the house for two weeks, with him talking and cooking for his dead wife when the neighbors called the police from the odor coming from the house. They found his wife's body badly decomposed and John was fighting the police from removing her. He became so violent they had to shoot him when he grabbed one of the officer's guns killing him instantly.  Selena sat smiling as she sat in the park on a bench watching the happy couple who had been married for ten years, still in love with each other as the day they first met at the park jogging when he was looking behind him at another female who had just past him knocking her down on the ground as they collided for she was looking down at the ground, they have never been apart since that fateful day. He was a dark skinned African American; she was a light skinned African American mixed with Caucasian American. His pet name for her was brown sugar. Both were tall, he stood six foot two, weighing two hundred and sixty pounds of pure muscle. She was six feet tall weighing one hundred eighty five pounds her body muscle was toned, both were athletically built, her hair was a light brown, long and straight like her mothers. They both were wearing black sport shorts and white jogging shoes; he wore a white muscle shirt, while she wore a half white tank top. Selena changed into a pair of very short sport shorts, a red sports bra, with matching red jogging shoes. She began jogging behind them working her way up beside him.  'Hi I am Selena would you mind if I jog with you two some guys were bothering me.' She asked noticing the first thing he looked at was her breast.  'Sure you can join us.' His wife Alekka told her smiling so sweetly at her.' I am Alekka and my husband Ken.' She told her.  'Nice meeting you Alekka and Ken. Thank you for rescuing me.' She said looking at Alekka first then smiling up at him with the start of the spell she had cast.  As they jogged Ken could not keep from sneaking looks at her breast as they bounced when she jogged, I'll bet they bounce during sex too. He thought to himself. What's wrong with me thinking like that about her? The more they ran the more he started envisioning her naked in front of him looking seductively massaging her breast. These were the visions she sent to him to see. Damn it I have to stop this before I get an erection! Scolding himself for his thoughts of Selena.  Alekka liked the woman for some strange reason.' We are going to cook out at our house and swim in the pool your more then welcome to join us.' She told her unaware of her husbands thoughts or the way he was looking at Selena.  'Sounds great to me.' She smiled innocently as if she was unaware of the looks and thoughts he was having about her.  They gave her their address and phone number just in case she got lost going to their house. As the couple drove home he fantasized about her swimming in the pool naked getting an erection. Stop it man! He thought to himself. Once at their house they changed into their suits, his were a bright yellow matching her bikini when she suddenly remembered she had to go to the store for some food and drinks slipping a dress over her suit.  'I will be right back.' She told him kissing him good bye.  As soon as Alekka left Selena rang the door bell to be greeted by Ken who looked at her standing in a white netted beach jacket she wore opened, a white one piece swim suit cut up high over her hips, the back had very little material revealing her rounded plump ass, the top had straps that snapped around her neck, cut into a v down to her navel exposing most of her large rounded breast. He felt himself getting aroused looking at her.  'Hello Ken, I think you're happy to see me.' She said smiling looking at his pants seeing he was very much aroused. She walked past him and purposely touched his stomach softly with her hand.  Her touch made his desire rage for her as he walked up to her watching her remove her jacket seeing her hardened nipples through the suit. She looked at him hungrily with her eyes.  'Where is Alekka?' she asked as if she didn't already know.  'She went to the store for some things.' He told her feeling like he was being pulled into her body by her eyes.  'I need something too Ken.' She told him dropping her jacket to the floor; she approached him placing her hand in his trunks.  Before he knew what had happened he was on top of her on the floor ravishing her body, feeling sensations exploding with in his body as they rolled over kissing while she rode on top of him exploding into a maddening climax.  When Alekka came home they were sitting by the pool, she noticed her husband was touching her inner thigh. Putting down her bags she walked out to let them know she was home. 'Hi, glad to see you could make it Selena.' She said forcing a smile as her husband never looked at her once; he just kept looking at Selena.  'I am too that I made it here.' She told her looking at Ken when she spoke.  'Well I am going to go start getting things ready. Ken would you help me?' she asked trying to get his attention.  'No, I will stay here with Selena to keep her company.' He told his wife totally ignoring her.  She turned around fuming to go prepare the hamburgers for the cook out. When she looked out at them they were in the pool. She could not believe her eyes as he was behind her caressing her breast, her arms wrapped around his neck, their bodies were moving. She looked to see their suits on the ground. Dropping the meat on the floor feeling the tears burning her eyes she walked out to the pool grabbing the bowl of ice. Finding her husband having sex with this slut who invaded her house and her marriage.  'Oh you two will have to cook for your selves I am leaving. 'She told them as they were next to edge of the pool totally oblivious to her; she dumped the ice over their heads which had started to melt.' Thought you needed cooling off!' she yelled running from the pool area grabbing her keys to her car.  Seduced By An Entity Ch. 25 by Erotica_Writings © The shock of the ice broke the spell that Selena had on Ken. 'Oh my God what have I done?' he cried out as he tried getting out of the pool.  'I have not been satisfied yet.' She grabbed him looking in his eyes casting her spell again, wrapping her arms around his neck kissing him.  'Oh please you're making me ill.' A female's voice told them.  As the two in the pool looked up to see Jada caster in her warrior uniform standing with her hands on her hips. Standing next to her was Coral shadow. 'Go save his wife before she goes over the cliff that this dumb bitch arranged.' She told her then Coral shadow vanished.  'You're the dumb bitch! Do you know who I am?' she asked Jada caster.  'Yes, Selena the slut.' She said dryly, she thought of the wolf witch who helped to kill Mystic Shadow.' Well, I am Jada Caster, warrior of the white light and I am going to kick your ass!' she yelled looking at the man still kissing the back of her neck fondling her breast.  Jada caster lifted him from the pool while she froze the witch. Holding his body in mid air she chanted. ' I Jada Caster sister Of Mystic Shadow reversing the spell cast on this man from the witch I am soon sending to hell!' she said reversing Salena's spell.  The man was still in the air looking down at Jada Caster. 'Who are, what you are?' he asked seeing that he and Selena were naked.  'ok lets make this quick, I am the good witch, she is the bad witch, I am going to kick the shit out of her before sending her to hell, you were having sex with her. Your wife caught you ran out is about to go over a cliff and die.' She told him.  He looked horrified by her words. 'Die? Go save her!' he yelled still floating in the air.  Jada Caster sat him down on the ground slowly. 'Already taking care of it stud, Coral shadow should be catching the car right now, setting it back on the ground. Now you stand here behind me so I can finish this before your wife gets back here, and put your clothes on.' She told him looking down at him then smiling as she looked back up to face.' Nice.' She told him with a wink as he quickly pulled his pants on feeling the blood rush to his face from embarrassment.  Jada caster unfroze the wicked witch pulling her up out of the water with her powers she slammed her down on the ground hard and quick, Jada caster jumping through the air landed on her face with her boots. She beat the witch severely. She could see Mystic Shadow's face and body, when they returned her from being attacked. The angrier she got hot tears ran down her face as she used her martial arts to beat her to her a bloody pulp. Holding her up by the back of neck she looked at the man. 'Find her hard to resist now?' she asked him full of rage then releasing the witch watching her falling to the ground.' This is for you Mystic Shadow.' She said blowing the witch up, it felt as if a nuclear bomb went off. Jada Caster fell to the ground on her knees holding her one hand over her mouth crying. 'Mystic Shadow I miss you so much! I don't know if I can continue on without you!' she cried as the man stood still not knowing what to do for her.  The spirit warriors saw her pain over the loss of her fallen sister as they took the screaming witch to be delivered to hell. When they saw Mystic Shadow floating down to her. The man looked at the angel standing before them in the white glittering gown. 'You will heal in time my beloved sister; I am still with you in the spirit world. Continue my battle against evil for it was evil that caused my destruction, don't let them win.' She told Jada Caster who looked up at her through her tears of sorrow.  'I promise to continue your battle.' she told Mystic Shadow who turned into sparkling gold lights as she vanished.  She looked at the man.' You were a victim of evil, tomorrow when you and your wife awake everything will be back to normal. Next time you're tempted by evil cry out to God at that moment, instead of waiting for it to cause the damage as it has here today.' She said getting up to her feet.  Suddenly there was a loud explosion with black smoke rising into the air.  The man cried out with the love in his heart for his wife. 'Alekka!' he stood looking at the smoke, tears ran down his face.  'No God, take me instead for I was the weak one!' He cried as the pain of losing his wife cut through his heart like a knife.  Jada Caster put her hand on his shoulder knowing the pain he was feeling. 'I know your pain my friend that is why it is important to live each day as our last; we never know when we might loose that special person or persons in our life.' She told him as her tears ran down her face as she thought of the deceit she did to Mystic Shadow before her death.  Coral Shadow saw the woman's car driving recklessly all over the road then going over the cliff, she was able to freeze it in motion so she could get the woman out of the car. Coral shadow appeared at the car window. 'Open the window and take my hand. Hurry! I can't hold the car much longer!' she yelled struggling to keep the car from falling.  The woman was so scared she did as she was told to do. Rolling down the window she grabbed Coral shadows hand when they vanished as the car plunged to the bottom bursting into a ball of fire. They stood on the edge of the cliff as the woman realized she could have been in there if this woman hadn't showed up.  'Are you an angel?' she asked looking at Coral Shadow.  'My name is Coral Shadow I am a witch, a warrior of the white light. We protect the innocents from evil. You broke the evil witch of seduction's spell by throwing the ice on them; it allowed your husband time to cry out to God before she put him under again.' She tried to explain to the woman.  'Well how do we get rid of her?' Alekka asked scared of what this evil witch might do to her since Alekka knew she had to have put a spell on the car.  Coral shadow smiled taking her hand.' It's safe to go back now, I am sure my sister Jada caster has taken care of her.' She told her as they vanished.  They appeared back at the pool side where her husband sat on a patio chair crying into his hands. He looked up because he could smell Alekka's perfume, seeing his wife with Coral Shadow he smiled. 'You're alright!' he yelled smiling running to his wife taking her into his arms.' I am so sorry brown sugar.' He told her crying.  Jada Caster looked at them knowing they truly loved each other.' We are going to leave; when we are gone from here the memory of today will be gone. As a gift we are leaving you the knowledge of when evil is approaching so you will be able to ask for help before it is too late.' She told them as she waved her hand over them and vanished.  'Oh wait a minute.' Coral Shadow told Jada caster. She went back replacing a duplicate car of the woman's in the drive way smiling and she vanished.  Jada Caster with the help of the Furies placed a bounty on any shape shifter that was a witch transforming in to a wolf. With in less then a year with daily persistence upon her and the Furies there was not another witch living with the ability to change into a wolf to attack another mortal or supernatural being. This was their way of also honoring the High Priestess who treated them with respect and it was helping Jada Caster to over come her loss of her fallen sister. Murk caster was becoming more victorious over tracking down evil and destroying it in honor of his beloved wife who gave up her life to destroy evil.  The day had come for Mystic caster to give birth to her child. Mystic Shadow felt the contractions her daughter was having.  'The day has come for Mystic caster to give birth.' She told Knight Shadow, Fire caster and Mystic of light. Knowing this was the day that the white light had been waiting for.  'I will make you a bet if it's a boy you have to go with me where ever I want for one day.' Knight Shadow told her.  'I accept your bet, but if it's a girl you have to go where ever I want for the day.' She told him smiling for she already knew the sex of Mystic caster's birth.  They showed up in the room where the birth was taking place, Mystic caster looked up to see her mother , uncle, grand father and Mystic of light for not only were they there to watch the birth to add protection for the dark side would try to locate Mystic caster to stop this day. Guardian caster also ordered every warrior to surround the room, Mystic Shadow did the same with the spirit warriors so nothing could get through to this room and then Murkcaster, Guardian caster, were to remove them to a secluded area.  Mystic Shadow looked at Murkcaster seeing how his grieving over her was wearing him down, knowing he had to remain a live for another twenty one years, realizing he could not go that long with out love or would be dead with in a year, she needed him to protect their daughter for she couldn't. Looking at Crystal caster she thought to herself. You will give my husband the love he needs and the wife I have chosen for him. Good bye my love its time for me to let you go so you may live. I do love you with all my heart. A tear dropped from her face landing on his heart.  Murkcaster looked at the tear drop then at his wife. He saw the look in her eye something was happening. When he heard the doctor say 'we have a boy!' holding the boy up high so everyone could see the next High Priest.  'I won the bet.' Knight Shadow told her.  'Wait something is wrong.' She told him as her daughter began to scream again, everyone looked surprised even the doctor, except for Guardian caster and Mystic Shadow as they smiled at each other. Today the future High Priest and High Priestess were born. Mystic Shadow went to her grand mother explaining of the importance of Murkcaster staying alive and she had picked his next wife for him. Tears came to her eyes for she thought she would have been his only one love. Knowing what she had to do, she went to Murk caster's room. 'We need to talk.' She told him holding back her tears. 'You must let me go completely, even from your heart. You must remain alive for twenty one years when our grandson would be of age to claim his throne.' She told him seeing the confusion in his face.  'So why do I have to stop loving you? Why do I have to let you go?' he asked.  Not being able to hold back her tears.' Because you're dying inside from your broken heart.' She told him crying.  'I want to join you.' He told her wishing he could just hold her and if he was dead he would be able to.  'No! Damn it for once it's not what you want! It must be done for our child and grand children.' She told him.  'Why? Have you fell in love with Knight Shadow? He did conveniently die right after you!' He yelled at her.  'I warned you to stay away! I made you promise and you broke it! As with all the promises you ever made to me! I had a vision he would be killed trying to protect you from the death that he met instead!' she yelled knowing she would have to tell him what was not true.' I don't love you anymore!' she yelled at him. Those words broke her heart. 'Set me free please.' She said crying for the pain in her eyes ripped her heart out.  'No, I will never love another woman or marry another woman.' He told her refusing to let go of her for he intended to join her very soon as jealousy of Knight Shadow was consuming him.  'You haven't any choice in this matter for our grand children will be protected even if it costs me your love.' She told him vanishing.  Standing on the other side of his door she cried, she did not want to let go of him. Her heart was breaking, this time she knew she was really gone from him, just as he was gone from her. Guardian caster stood there looking at her grand daughter taking her in her arms as she had the gift to touch and hold spirits.  'You did the right thing dear. I will start the union of Murkcaster and Crystal caster.' She told her grand daughter knowing the thought of his up coming marriage was hurting her as much as it hurt Guardian caster to do. As soon as Mystic Shadow left Guardian caster performed the spell to begin the union that Mystic Shadow arranged to protect the children for Murkcaster was actually mourning him self to death.  Guardian caster thought back to when her daughter who gave birth to twins Mystic Shadow and her twin brother Flame caster, these were the two with their seven warriors and Flame casters second in command who were to destroy all evil as it was in the book for their powers together were powerful beyond belief, but the dark side sent a demon who killed Flame caster as he slept in his crib. Charmelmystic came in the room in time to blow the demon up before he could kill her daughter Mystic Shadow, that was when they decided for the protection of the children they were to be placed into an adoption agency. They took the secret of the children's location even from the High Council with them to their graves.  Mystic caster named the girl after her mother Mystic Shadow, her son she named Flame caster UN aware of the twin brother of her mother. Destiny would not be stopped for it was written for the destruction of evil to take place and it would not be stopped.  Murkcaster and Crystal Shadow started to become infatuated with each other as they stayed at the Mansion of Fire caster in Madrid with Guardian caster, and twenty of the warriors who were to guard the children with their life. Guardian Caster watched as the romance blossomed.  Murkcaster and Crystal shadow were swimming in the pool wrestling around when he looked into her eyes kissing her passionately, he ran his hands over her body. They took their suits off making passionate love for hours. He carried her upstairs to his bedroom where they continued they love making until dawn.  Murkcaster looking lovingly at her touching her face softly.' I want to know will you marry me?' he asked her feeling so much love for her.  Crystal caster looked at him. 'Oh yes, I will marry you.' She told him for she felt the same love for him.  Guardian caster broke the news that they were going to marry. Mystic Shadow looked at her grand mother as tears filled her eyes. 'Even though it is what I wanted, that I arranged. It doesn't make the pain any less.' She cried in to her hands.  'I know child, you have had to make great sacrifices in your life and even in death you are still making sacrifices. It is time that you too find love now. I know of a man who truly loves you dear and you have never stopped loving him, maybe you did not love him as much as Murkcaster for you gave him the gift of life.' She told her.  'We're dead so what is the point?' she asked her grandmother.  'Just because you are dead does not mean you can not live and love. Remember you are special spirits with powers.' She told her kissing her good bye before she returned to the mansion.  Mystic Shadow sat there thinking of their conversation when she went to the mansion seeing with her own eyes of the love between Murkcaster and Crystal Shadow with out being noticed. Seeing them together happy she was able to get the closure she needed.  Mystic Shadow summoned Knight Shadow to a deserted beach where she had torches burning, a beach house with a fire place burning. She wore a long seductive blue gown fitting tight to her body, a v neck line that showed her cleavage, her hair was up as she wore diamond earrings. He looked around wondering what was going on when he walked inside seeing her standing there looking so beautiful when he noticed he was now wearing a black tuxedo.  'What is going on?' he asked her bewildered by all of this.  Mystic Shadow walked up to him wrapping her arms around his neck. 'I love you, I have never stopped loving you, and I was running from you.' She told him as she started the song from Bread singing it to him by using her powers to create the music to play all their love songs  'Baby I am through running its true I'd be a fool to try to escape you when maybe I am beat but oh what a sweet surrender. You keep your rights I'll take your nights. No one can lose when we turn the lights out I'm tasting defeat, loving that sweet surrender I 'm giving all of myself to you, but I didn't really lose at all.' before she could finish singing the song to him he kissed her passionately spinning them around from the joy and love he had been missing coming back to him.  He looked down at her standing still looking into her eyes as the love songs from Bread continued to play.' I love you with all my heart, it belongs to you completely. I want to marry you even in death.' He told her as he carried her to the bedroom where they made love to each other rekindling a love that was destined to be even in death.  The next morning they summoned Guardian caster to them. 'Has something happened?' she asked looking around at the beach house smiling for she knew they had reunited.  'Yes something has happened; I want to marry your grand daughter even if we are dead.' He told her holding Mystic Shadow in his arms.  'I told you Mystic Shadow you're a special kind of spirit who can still live and love.' She said smiling at the two. 'It was written that you two were to marry, but of course evil put its nasty hand in it breaking you two up. When she met Murkcaster she fell in love with him of course we could not break it up or we would have been like evil, so they continued even though she could not shut her heart to you, you realized after she had married the mistake you made by letting her go without fighting for her. There was no way for us to change it.' She told them seeing the love between them.' Murkcaster loved her this is true, but it was not a real love, a real love there is no hurt, jealousy, it is not cruel, but is forgiving. He would throw things up at her in fights, things that she had no control over; he'd call her nasty names because of work having her to do certain things. When she was pregnant you questioned her how? Believed what she told you and stood by her side. He only came back because he did not want you having her. When we all thought she died from the fall it was you who told the heavens you did not want to live without her. You have always been there supporting her in any decisions she has made, defending her against those who wished her harm. Even though Mystic caster is not your daughter you gave up your life for her because she had just lost one parent you couldn't allow her to lose another. Why did you chose to let him live instead of you? For the love for her mother.' she told them as they listened to her knowing it was all true.  Mystic Shadow looking at her grand mother suspiciously.' Why was it written in the book to marry a mortal since I am a witch?' she asked watching her face.  'You were not to marry a mortal, but a warlock who was a mighty warrior who would have been second in command should anything happen to your brother, he would become the High Priest.' She said with tears in her eyes.  'My brother?' she asked shocked. 'What happened to him?' Mystic shadow asked her grand mother.  'Your brother was killed by a demon in his crib, which was when all the children were placed in an adoption agency.' She told her sadly, 'Your true soul mate has been waiting patiently to be united with his bride.' she told smiling as tears sparkled in her eyes. 'He and his brother was placed into the adoption agency, he grew up fell in love and will marry his intended Bride tonight taking his rightful place back as High Priest.' She told them smiling.  They looked at each other then back at Guardian caster. Knight Shadow was shocked to hear the news. 'why didn't I know? Why didn't I get my powers when you found us?' he asked feeling confused. 'where is my brother?' he asked never knowing he had a brother.  'He has always been your partner.' She told him as she continued to tell them what had happened to them 'Because evil changed what was to be it prevented your powers by breaking your true loves heart, which caused the break up. Everything goes back to how it was suppose to be when you wed tonight at mid night. I will take the powers of Mystic caster's mother and real father to protect her and her children.' She told them smiling.

492,492,2822042,0,47,"       Tragedy Strikes Here by Erotica_Writings ©  Melissa, a stunning blond of thirty years of age, divorced with two small children, she works in a truck stop, her hour glass figure compliments the pink and white waitresses' uniform with her even tan, her hair pulled up into a pony tail the men watch her every step in her white sneakers as she hustles to serve these hungry truckers their food. Her crystal blue eyes sparkle as much as her smile when she speaks.  Leona a tall, thin, brunette, with big brown eyes, shares a mobile home with Melissa. 'Did you finish that movie last night?' She asked pouring coffee into the trucker's cup that was sneaking a peak at her small breast under her uniform fantasizing about her licking his hardened shaft slowly around the head and down the shaft.  Melissa stands behind the counter listening to the sound of clanking dishes, people talking and laughing, she wished she could wiggle her nose and her troubles would be over with. 'I tried to, but I ended up falling to sleep on the couch.' She told her watching the trucker's hand moving over his crotch as he watched Leona, weirdo. She thought to herself.  Leona smiled at Melissa when she realized what she was looking at. 'How do you like it?' she asked the trucker who was ready to explode his juices in front of God and everyone around him. His erection suddenly left as he thought he was caught jacking off discreetly in front of the whole truck stop.  'Like what?' he asked.  'Why your breakfast silly.' She asked smiling at him knowing she had ruined his fun for him.  Damned bitch. He thought to him self. 'Fine. It's fine.' He said in an agitated voice and then he left abruptly.  'Wonder if it was something I said?' she asked Melissa who was laughing at the frustrated trucker.  'Po thang, the old mean waitress ruined his oozing all over himself.' She told Leona teasingly. Leona smiled wickedly at Melissa running her tongue slowly over her lips. 'He can't touch this, want too?' She asked laughingly.  'You tease you wicked wench.' Melissa said as she sat a plate in front of a huge trucker with long black hair, a beard, wearing a white shirt, jeans, a brown leather belt with the words *kick ass* on the back, he wore black western boots.  'You two ladies can use the bed in my rig, Want too? 'He asked playfully. Melissa leaned over the counter exposing her cleavage to him.  'Maybe some other time and you can watch.' She told him touching his beard.  'All right you two whores get back to work.' Mike their boss yelled from the kitchen as he had been listening and watching Melissa's ass as she bent over the counter. He smiled wishing his wife had to leave for the week end so he could get Melissa to come over to make his bed with him still in it. Mike had just turned fifty – five years old, he was short, over weight, with black receding hair, he always looked sweaty. He wiped his hands on the white apron he wore over his white T – shirt and black checkered chef pants that he wore his black dress shoes with. He smiled as he had thoughts of him inside her plump rounded ass. 'Man is it hot in here.' He said wiping the sweat off of his brow.  Melissa's heart began to race when she saw the big yellow rig pull into the parking lot. Her hands began to shake when she saw Jeff climbing down from the cab; he looked delicious dressed in a black muscle shirt, black tight jeans, a black leather belt with a wide silver belt buckle with a naked woman engraved into it, black shiny boots with silver cleats. His long black hair flowed freely in the breeze; he was very muscular built with a six-foot four frame. Melissa felt butterflies in her stomach. Oh God he's so hot. She thought to her self.  'Morning darling.' He said sitting down in front of her.  'Morning Hon., what can I get for you?' she asked looking into his pitch black eyes.  'Why shoot little lady, I'll take you to go.' He told her smiling like a shy little boy.  'Watch it or I'll pack myself up right now.' She told him pouring coffee into his cup hoping her hand would not start shaking.  'What you haven't started climbing into that to go bag?' he asked her smiling so charmingly at her melting her heart even more.  Melissa tried to keep her cool, but she had fallen in love with him the first time she laid eyes on him.' I tried, but the Dern thing ripped.' She told him putting her hands on hips laughing.  'I am staying in town for a few days, want to see a movie?' he asked her. Her heart sank thinking of class tonight. 'What time do you want to pick her up?' Leona asked him butting into their conversation. He smiled at Leona. 'Well. Seven?' he asked.  'Seven, it's a date.' Leona told him.  The rest of the day Melissa was so nervous thinking about their date tonight. When five o'clock came they both hurried out of the diner and home to their two bedroom mobile home, they shared together in the country. Melissa picked a red silk halter dress that fit tight to her waist then flared out too just above her knees, a red six inches spiked heels that wrapped around her ankle, a red lace thong, she carefully shaved her tanned legs and bikini line. She stood naked in front of the mirror looking at her body that was evenly tanned from her and Leona tanning in the nude outside by their small wading pool.' Not bad for thirty, with two kids.' She said with both hands on her breast.  Melissa carefully applied her make up, she wore her long blond hair down and parted on the side, she looked gorgeous when she had placed the small red earrings on her ears and sprayed her favorite perfume on when the door bell rang. 'The boy is early.' She said smiling as she looked at her watch and thankful that her ex husband had the kids for the week end. She heard yelling coming from the front room, but it sounded like Mike's voice; there was a loud thud then silence. Her heart pounded in her chest as she quickly ran to see what had happened when she saw Mike dragging Leona's body into the mobile home so he could shut and lock the door.  'Melissa.......' He said dropping Leona's unconscious body on the ground and lunged at Melissa.  Melissa ran to her room with Mike just inches from her. Melissa tried shutting the door but he over powered the door. 'What is wrong with you?' she asked backing up into the room.  'You know what I want, what I have wanted from the start! You as my whore. Now if you think some hot shot truck driver is going to come and get that ass of yours! Fuck you bitch; I pay you extra money as an investment into what I am going to be fucking!' He yelled with his veins popping out of his head.  He had her pinned up against the wall with his body against hers, his hands ran up her thighs under her dress, he squeezed her ass checks as he kissed her cleavage. He placed his hand into her thong finding she was wet, in his mind she was returning his kisses hot and passionately.  'You're a freak.' He told her taking his hard erection out of his pants. He turned her around so she was facing the wall and entered her anally. He became like an animal, as he pleasured him self with her body. When he was done, she dropped to the ground, he couldn't understand why she was crying.  'You wanted it just like I did Melissa.' He said pulling her up off the ground. 'I better not hear any differently either Melissa, it would be a shame if something happened to your kids and friend out there.' He told her then kissed her good bye.  Melissa fell to the ground crying, she could not believe he raped her, he actually believed she wanted him. 'Oh help me please.' She cried when she heard someone coming down the hall way. Leona came into the room with her mouth all bloody from him punching her in the mouth. 'Oh I am so sorry Melissa.' She said dropping to her knees holding her friend in her arms.  Melissa cried hysterically. 'He thinks I liked it as much as he did! He hurt me Leona. Oh God what I am going to do? She asked crying into Leona's arms.  'We're going to go to the police that is what we are going to do.' She told her helping her to her feet.  Melissa began shaking her head. 'No, he threatened the kids and you, no I won't go and put my babies at risk.' She said crying.  They heard Jeff pull up in a white car.' Oh no what are we going to do?' she asked looking at Leona through her tears.  'Go wash up, hurry I'll keep him busy.' She said pushing Melissa out of the way.  Melissa hurriedly showered and reapplied her make up, she changed into a long white summer dress, with white lace thongs and matching bra. White heels and removed the only red earring left on her ears. She looked beautiful, but she had a sadness within her eyes now instead of a sparkle.  At the restaurant Jeff noticed the sadness about this lady he had come quite smitten with. 'Penny for your thoughts Pretty Lady.' He said as they sat in the dimly lit restaurant sipping red wine.  She tried controlling the tears building up in her eyes.' I am not thinking about anything.' She told him. 'I really have a horrible head ache, could we go?' she asked him wanting to go home and shower again.  The ride home was quiet; she kept reenacting the rape over and over in her mind. I hate him; he is going to pay for this. She thought to her self as they drove into the dark country night, She watched the lightening bugs dancing in the woods.  A week had gone by since Mike raped Melissa, both women had not returned to work and their jobs had been filled with two other waitresses that Mike was now sleeping with. Melissa and Leona began to follow him, filming him on their cam corder. They had followed him one evening to a motel where they filmed him and his new waitress having sex in the pool.  'We got him now.' Melissa told Leona as they called the police on the two lovers in the pool.  Melissa and Leona filmed Mike being arrested with his Mistress butt naked. The women stepped out from the room they had rented next to his, his mouth dropped when he saw them filming him. 'What the hell?' he asked as the police led him away. 'What are you two bitches up too?' he asked Leona when they walked passed the police car with him in it.  They waved as they were still filming him. Melissa made a horrible face at him. 'Put your clothes on ass hole.' Melissa told him walking past him.  Melissa and Leona showed Mike's wife the tape of her husband and told her of the rape he committed on Melissa. Maryann was a large woman of two hundred pounds, she was only five feet tall, with brown curly hair and brown eyes, she wore a lose fitting dress and brown penny loafers. Maryann cried at first watching the tape then went suddenly quiet when Mike walked into their home and saw his wife of twenty-two years with Melissa and Leona. Mike's face went beet red. He gritted his teeth.' I am going to kill you!' he yelled lunging at them and landing on top of Melissa strangling her, and suddenly everything became black and silent. The next morning at the diner Leona was waiting on customers as normal when Jeff came strolling into the diner looking around for Melissa, but he did not see her anywhere around.  'Where is Melissa?' Jeff asked as he sat down at the counter.  Leona smiled at him. 'She is cooking now.' She said pointing back at the kitchen where Melissa was flipping eggs.  'Morning Pretty Lady.' He told her. 'Hey where is Mike at?' he asked wondering why she was cooking.  'Hi hon. I guess Mike got more involved in his food then he liked and had a nasty accident. He won't be back.' She said as she lifted the lid to the large pan of stew she was cooking. I hope this isn't too bitter or tough.' She said laughing to her self.  Jeff looked at Melissa smiling at her. 'I have moved here, wonder if there's a chance of a Pretty Lady going with me to dinner tonight?' he asked almost holding his breath for her answer.  Melissa looked at him remembering the rape. She smiled at him. 'I think the odds are very good.' She told him getting another order out.  Three months had gone by since Mike's disappearance, Melissa and Jeff had become a steady couple and were even talking about marriage, Leona was working late at the diner when Maryann came in to see her. She seemed nervous.  'Something wrong Maryann?' she asked seeing how jittery she was.  'I feel like something bad is going to happen Leona.' She told her looking out at the parking lot.  'Like what?' Leona asked her.  'I am scared just like I use to be before, well you know Mike left.' She said to finger a napkin.  'You know he won't be coming back Maryann. He can't.' She told her patting her hand.  'I know I am just being silly.' She said smiling.' Well I am going to go home and I will see you tomorrow.' She told Leona.  Leona poured her self a cup of coffee when she felt a cold chill go through her body. 'Oh something evil crossed my path.' She said watching Maryann walk across the parking lot when suddenly she heard her screaming and an eighteen wheeler crushed her and never stopped. Leona was screaming as people were running to Maryann's crumpled body laying on the ground. Leona ran from the diner and to Maryann. She took her in her arms when Maryann opened her eyes.  'He's going to get us.' She told her as a tear fell from her eye.  'No, it was a horrible accident. You'll be all right.' She told her pushing the woman's bloody hair out of her face.  'I am so cold.' She said then closed her eyes taking her last breath.  Leona began crying and rocking back and forth. 'No don't go, please. Maryann don't go!' she cried holding her tightly until the ambulance and police arrived.  Melissa arrived as they were taking Maryann's body to the morgue.' What the hell happened Leona?' she asked her taking her into her arms.  Leona was crying hysterically. 'She said he was going to get us.' She cried into Melissa's arms.  Melissa looked at Leona strangely. 'Who is going to get us?' she asked Leona.  Leona became hysterical breaking away from Melissa. 'Mike! That's who is coming for us!' She said looking all around her like a scared animal. 'Oh God we're going to die!' she cried falling to the ground.  Melissa knelt down beside her.' He's gone, remember?' she asked her friend.  'He's back! He ran her down tonight!' she cried watching the eighteen wheeler sitting off in the darkness with the lights turned off.  Melissa grabbed her by her chin. 'Listen to me, there is no way in hell he is back and you know it.' She told her. 'Pull your self together Leona.' She told her helping her off the ground.  Melissa took Leona home after locking up the diner. She laid in her bed. She could hear Leona sobbing in her room. He hasn't come back. He can't. She thought to her self. She finally drifted off to sleep.  The next morning Leona was still upset. 'Before she died, she told me she was scared.' Leona told her holding her coffee cup with both hands as they sat at the kitchen table. 'I am scared Melissa.' She told her with tears filling her swollen eyes.  Melissa looked at Leona. 'Come on get dressed I will prove to you he isn't coming back.' She told her going into her room and changing into a pair of loose-fitting blue jeans that had wide legged bell bottoms, a purple T – shirt that exposed her midriff, a pair of white sneakers, her blond hair she pulled up into a pony tail.  Leona wore a pair of black sweat pants and a long white baggy T Shirt with white sneakers. The women left to go to where Mike was. They pulled in front of the diner, the blood of Maryann had not been cleaned away, and I'll have to call someone to come clean it up. Melissa thought to her self.  They walked slowly into the diner, Melissa looked around remembering the night the three of them had put Mike in here, and they struggled carrying his body into the freezer wrapped in a large oriental rug.  Leona and Melissa stood at the small freezer compartment, Melissa with shaky hands unlocked the pad lock on the freezer and there was Mike's lifeless body with the bullet hole in the side of his temple where Maryann had shot him as he strangled Melissa. 'See he isn't coming back.' She told Leona.  Melissa locked the pad lock on the freezer, Leona made coffee while Melissa called to have someone to come clean the blood off the ground in the parking lot. The diner would remain closed from this day forward.  A month had gone by and Leona had calmed down since Maryann's death. Leona and Melissa became worried when Maryann's son by a previous marriage reopened the truck stop. They felt sure they were going to prison. Both women had jobs at a local truck stop when Maryann's son Ben came to see them at their house.  Ben became interested in Leona when he saw her. 'I just wanted to let you know I cleaned out the freezers getting rid of all the rotten meat, you can come back to work there if you would like to.' He told them unable to take his eyes of blue off Leona.  Leona felt the same attraction to him. He must be in his forty's Leona thought to her self as she looked at how firm his body was, he was six feet tall, thin but muscularly built, his hair was brown and curly like his mother's.' We'll start tomorrow.' Leona told him with an ear to ear smile.  Melissa and Leona began working with Ben, three months had gone by when Melissa and Jeff had set a date to be married September 12th at seven p.m. in the gazebo in the center of town. All the towns people. Truckers from all over were invited to witness their union as Husband and wife.  September twelfth, 2003 had finally arrived, Melissa was nervous for today she would become Jeff's wife. Her gown was a duplicate of Princess Di, her children, Andy Melissa's five-year-old son wore a small white tux identical to Jeff's and Mandy wore a light pink frilly dress, with light pink gloves and black patten shoes. Leona wore a lavender gown similar to the design of Cinderella's, a horse and carriage arrived with Melissa, Leona and her children whose golden hair shined under the sun light. Jeff and Ben waited at the gazebo watching the children walking up to the gazebo tossing rose petals from side to side, then Leona followed them and finally Melissa was helped from the carriage by her coachman dressed in a black tux and top hat, he walked her to the gazebo. The high school band played here comes the bride; during the ceremony they played *I wanna know* softly by KC & JO. Melissa looked lovingly into Jeff's eyes. The preacher announced they were husband and wife. They walked slowly toward the carriage when Jeff fell to his knees; he had been struck through his heart by a bow and arrow. Melissa began screaming, Leona and Ben grabbed the children seeking safety for them, and people were surrounding Melissa and Jeff. Melissa dropped to her knees holding her husband in her arms. 'Please don't leave me.' She cried kissing his forehead.  'I will always be watching over you Pretty Lady.' He told her taking his last breath.  Melissa held his lifeless body in her arms. 'Jeff! No! Come back! Please Jeff!' she cried to him as his blood soaked into her wedding gown. The police had to pry her away from his body so they could remove him. Jeff's family helped her and the kid's home. The doctor had to sedate Melissa and Jeff's mother.  At his funeral there were truckers in their rigs with their lights on saying good bye to Jeff, his coffin with his body in it was delivered in his rig driven by his older brother for Jeff's last run. Melissa cried seeing the big yellow rig for the last time with Jeff in it. Leona tried to comfort the children as they watched his body in his casket being carried by his friends and two brothers. The preacher who married them was also servicing his funeral. 'We're all gathered here to see Jeff off on his last road trip from here to heaven, leaving behind his new bride Melissa and there two children, Andy and Mandy, His mother Pearl and two Brothers Bobby and Tom. We're going to miss Jeff but rejoice in knowing he is on a new adventure.' He told the crowd watching the casket being lowered into the ground and all the rigs began blowing their horns at the exact moment.  Tragedy Strikes Here by Erotica_Writings © After the funeral Melissa sat on the front porch of the mobile home starring into space grieving for her husband.' Why did he have to be killed? And who killed him?' she cried into her hands. 'Mike did.' Leona told her.  Melissa looked at her, 'don't, don't start that crap, not now, please Leona.' She said looking at her through her tears.  'None of us are safe.' Leona told her feeling that same fear she felt before.  Melissa became angry.' Stop it! I just buried my husband! Will you please let me mourn his death in peace?!' she yelled and ran into the mobile home and into her room.  Leona cried fearing the end was just around the corner for all of them.' She doesn't believe me. Oh God what can I do to save us from him?' she asked looking out at the trees across the highway as tears streaked her face.  A month had past since Jeff's murder and still there weren't any clues to his murderer. Melissa and Leona had just pulled into the truck stop and walking across the parking lot when they saw a black rig barreling down on them. Leona began screaming seeing Maryann's body flying up into the air. Melissa grabbed her pulling her across the parking lot with her, the huge truck trampled over the pumps causing an explosion to toss Melissa and Leona through the air. Ben ran outside in total disbelief of what he had just witnessed along with the rig still barreling down the road with flames coming from it. 'What the hell?' he asked not knowing what to make of this and believing Leona that Mike had returned from the dead.  At the hospital Melissa had suffered a compound fracture to her left leg, and Leona's left arm was broken in three different places. Ben stayed at their mobile home to help protect them, even though none of them knew how to fight something already dead. Melissa was at her wit's end. 'I refuse to let him win damn it!' she told Leona and Ben as they sat on the porch. They heard the engine of the eighteen wheeler coming down the highway.  'Quick get the kids and get out of here!' Melissa yelled trying to get out of her chair. Leona grabbed the children as Ben lifted Melissa into his arms and carried her to the car. Ben had just started the car when the eighteen wheeler came crashing through the mobile home. Throwing the car into drive, he quickly sped away with the huge truck on their tail. The children were screaming and crying as the huge truck was inches from their bumper. Leona was crying as she watched the truck from hell coming for them, Melissa could not believe her eyes when she saw another rig coming toward them, it was Jeff's and it sparkled brightly. Ben pulled the car over into a field as they watched the battle of the two eighteen wheelers and the winner gives them life or death.  The two huge rigs faced off on the road, their engines roaring loud, the sound was almost like two huge monsters screeching at each other. Then they began rolling slowly toward each other, until they were only inches from one another and then they slammed into each other, they kept this up until Jeff's truck could no longer start again, the black truck bearing down on him. The engine kept dying as he tried to start it, Melissa stood outside of the car screaming when the trucks collided into one large ball of fire. They were all silent as they watch the fire burning brighter and higher into the air, when the black truck came out of the flames directly at them. Melissa jumped into the car as they began speeding away from the devils truck.  'He's going to kill us!' Leona cried holding both children in her arms as the huge rig barred down on them and slammed into the rear end of the car, Ben tried to hold the car on the road. Up a head he saw the cliff coming up quick, he prayed he could manage to make the huge rig to go over the edge.  The huge rig had its bumper against the cars bumper pushing the car toward the edge of the cliff, everyone in the car was screaming, Ben had his foot tightly on the brakes, but the car was still heading toward the edge and then it soared through the air and burst into flames.

495,495,2822042,0,47,"       Seduced By An Entity Ch. 18 by Erotica_Writings © Mystic caster just turned twenty one, she was as beautiful as her mother and had her fathers intelligence, the powers of her parents, grand parents and ancestors, she would practice with the young male warriors who had trouble concentrating on their abilities because of her beauty and her body. She would wear a pair of black tight stretch pants, a white top that she cut in half with a pair of white sneakers. Her hair she wore pulled up into a tight ponytail on top of her head. One young warrior Lightening caster longed to ask her out, but he was to shy to ask her. He could hardly wait until his day that they worked out together. He was tall, with black curly hair, blue eyes; his body was of a Greek God. Today was his day to train with her, he waited impatiently for her, and she finally came even though she was twenty minutes late. He noticed she was not in her usual work out clothes, but in a pair of baggy pants and a sweatshirt. She smiled at him as she approached him and suddenly she lunged at him causing him to fall backwards with her landing on top of him on the ground.  “when are you going to ask me out?” she asked him as she laid on top of his body smiling down at him with her brown eyes, her long brown hair tied up in a pony tail.  “Tonight?” he asked shocked that she felt the same way about him.  “Ok, I accept your offer for a date tonight.” She said as their faces were inches away from one another and she slowly kissed him lightly on his lips.  He wrapped his arms around her kissing her passionately as his heart beat wildly for he had always dreamt of this day. She looked into his blue eyes running her fingers through his hair. “Why have you made me wait so long for you?” she asked him with a pouting look on her face.  “I was afraid you’d reject me if I approached you.” He told her as he kissed her lips lightly.  “Well we have to call off training I need to get ready for tonight.” She said kissing him one last time then getting up off him as she ran off.  He sat up on the ground leaning back on one arm smiling as he watched her run into the cottage where he would pick her up tonight for their date.  The dark side had been watching Mystic caster as they were planning her demise for she was to powerful to keep around or evil could be vanquished all together. They summoned the most evil warlock they had, Karlin. He was not only evil , but handsome as well, his hair blond and perfectly in place, his chiseled looks, his body was toned and very tanned, his eyes were of a pale green. He was known for his ability to trap women with his seduction, children with false kindness earning their trust then suck their very life out of them turning them into grains of dust, on witches he not only turned into grains of dust, but collected their powers and souls. He sat in the dark dungeon of evil making his deal to destroy this witch he wanted one other witch who vanquished his brothers in Jamaica and releasing the children’s souls they had collected.  “I want Mystic Shadow as well as her daughter; I will turn them both into grains of dust.” He told them with pure hatred for Mystic Shadow causing his eyes to glow red.  “You know we want all of those bitches done away with, along with the three warlocks.” They told him.  “So be it then.” He said as he looked down at his assistant a petite blond with blue eyes that he kept half dressed.” We need to have a private meeting before I begin my mission.” He told the Dark Side leaders. Taking her into a room for her to sexually please him.  Mystic caster was so excited over her date with Lightening caster. She and the six witches, her mother, grand mother and Norma, who was very old now and laid in her bed watching the youngest of the witches trying on different outfits, finally she picked the perfect outfit, a white satin short sleeveless dress, white knee boots, and she wore her hair French braided with daisies inter twined into the braid.  “You have protection right Patty?” Tammy asked her causing the younger witch to blush who was given Patty’s earth name to carry on.  “I don’t plan on doing that with him tonight.” She said trying to cover her embarrassment.  “That’s what we all say.” Gloria told her as she threw her a package. ”just to be on the safe side, you never know.” She told her smiling and walking away.  The witches all laughed even Norma gave a chuckle.  Poor Norma she has been through so much. Mystic Shadow thought to her self.  That night when Lightening caster came to pick up Mystic caster Aggatha reminded them that when they were around humans they are Patty and Tony. The young couple vanished as they went to a restaurant in the Bahamas where they then walked down the beach. He took her into his arms kissing her.  “I have loved you since we were six years old.” he told her looking down into her eyes as he softly touched her face.  “I have always loved you too, like I knew we were meant to be together.” She told him laying her head on his chest listening to his heart beat.” I want to make love to you.” She told him closing her eyes as if making a wish.  “I want to make love to you, but I want it to be perfect when we do.” He told her kissing her passionately.  That night at the end of their date she lay in bed envisioning when they finally make love together.  The next morning Aggatha told Mystic Shadow about the rash of attacks on witches and humans. Their souls and powers were collected then the victim turned into grains of dust. Mystic Shadow knew she and the eight witches would have to go and find the one responsible for these crimes. In addition, she knew who was responsible, Karlin was. She would blast him sending him to be with his evil brothers that she destroyed in Jamaica.  The eight witches went to the manor where they had not been in years; nothing had changed being back there. Mystic Shadow was looking through some papers when a cold wind blew past her, she looked around, but she saw nothing. She walked slowly around the room feeling it again and the curtains began to blow, but they were actually closed and there were not any windows open for a draft to move them. She stood still trying to sense a presence when in a quick flash Fredrick was standing in front of her. She jumped not expecting it to be her father.  “Damn it! Can you just make a normal appearance!” she yelled at him.  “You haven’t even sent me a father’s day card.” He told her as he looked as if he were pouting with his hands on his hips. “You’re not very happy to see me considering the last time I saw you when you got married.” He told her walking to the window looking out at the grounds.  She looked at him strangely.” you watched me get married?” she asked him almost shocked.  “Yes, I didn’t make an appearance for fear of ruining your day, but you were quite beautiful Cheyenne.” He told her. “Is that my grand daughter?” he asked pointing at Mystic caster.  “Yes and don’t be going scaring her either.” She told him.  “She looks just like you.” He told her as he watched his grand daughter walking around the grounds.  “What have you been up to?” she asked sensing sadness about him.  Fredrick did not turn around for fear she would see the tears in his eyes. “Oh just ghostly things, you know.” He told her clearing his voice. “I have missed you, all of you know.” He told her keeping his head turned.  “I know I am sorry, I promise to visit more often, I promise. “She told him feeling bad for being neglectful to him.  Fredrick turned around smiling. “Well a father can’t ask for much more then that now, can he?” he asked with a huge smile for he was feeling better now.  Karlin was watching a young waitress with short brown hair, very thin and of Spanish descent. He used his charm on her making her his next victim. He stayed until closing, he persuaded the young girl who was only eighteen- years- old to let him take her home.  The girl believing he was a kind gentle man let him take her home.  “Could I bother you for a cup of coffee?” he asked smiling very charming.  “Of course you may for your being so nice to me tonight.” She told him as they went up to her apartment.  As they stood in the kitchen, he touched her face softly with his fingertips, “why don’t you change into something more comfortable. “He told her smiling as his fingers ran softly down the side of her face to the side of her neck, she smiled at him, and his touch was almost intoxicating to her.  She excused her self to go change into something more comfortable. When she came back, she was wearing a pair of loose shorts with just a white tank top, not bothering to cover her small breast with a bra. He walked up to her gently taking her chin into his hand then kissing her softly. She did not fight him, he took her in his arms kissing her passionately, feeling her responding to his kisses he placed his hand over her breast and again she did not stop him.  “I am going to have sex with you now.” He told her kissing her neck and lifting her in his arms. He carried her to her bedroom, placing her gently on the floor and watched her undress slowly. Her movements were almost sensual. He disrobed and walked slowly to her, picking her up in his arms he made passionate love to her on the bed for hours. She never had a man to make her feel so sensual and free about her body before. She did not want it to end. He lay on top of her pleasuring her and then he began to suck her air out of her lungs. She began to struggle, she tried to scream but she could not break the suction his mouth had formed on hers. He began to become violent in his love making as he literally sucked the oxygen from her body. Her eyes were bulging from their sockets. Her soul entered into his mouth. He got up off her dead body, smiling he turned her to dust with his hands. He vanished from the room laughing at his conquest.  Mystic caster and Mystic Shadow both showed up in the girl’s room only to find a pile of dust in her bed. Their vision did not come until she felt in fear of her life. Unfortunately, that was towards the end of her sexual encounter with him. The women looked at the bed feeling they had let the girl down in protecting her from evil. There wasn’t anything else they could do for her now. They found a phone booth downstairs of her apartment, they told the police they heard screaming from her apartment, the police would have to determine what the dust was in her bed then notify her family so they would have closure of her death. They returned to the manor unaware that Karlin was sitting on top of a building watching them. He smiled for he was very proud that he defeated them in protecting the innocent girl.  The eight witches sat around the table in the kitchen of the manor discussing that night, they knew she had to feel safe until the very end when he killed her.  “She did not feel any fear from him and when we got the vision she had already been turned to dust.” Cheyenne told the witches.  “So how will we capture him?” Gloria asked.  “We could summon him, but he is a very powerful warlock it might not work.” Mystic caster told them.  “Maybe a spell to lead us to him then.” Tammy said as she bit into an apple.  “We can try, but he more then likely has himself blocked from spells that can track him.” Cheyenne told her as she thought to her self.  Karlin found another victim this time a twenty five year old model he was posing as a scout looking for fresh faces for his lay out he was doing on swimwear. He made an appointment to meet her at the office he had rented, using his magic he made the beach scenery with professional cameras large fans to have her long blond hair blowing as if it were the wind. He had her to model a gold bikini with the top shaped into shells, the bottom was gold with hardly any material covering her. Karlin a very lustful warlock enjoyed snapping pictures of her lying on her side on a black beach towel with her one hand holding up her hair looking at the camera seductively. Her eyes were green and they looked as if they always sparkled.  “Would you like to stop for lunch? My treat.” He told her smiling so charming.  “Alright that sounds great.” She told him smiling. He helped her up off the towel, his hand moved to her waist.  “since we have the beach setting why don’t I go pick up something and we could have a picnic, what do you say?” he asked as he still did not move his hand.  “Great I will be waiting here for you to return.” She told him smiling she felt his hand pull her a little closer to him.  “I think it will be the lunch of a life time for you.” He told her as they were now only inches away from one another. He kissed her forehead then left.  He was only gone ten minutes when he returned with wine, strawberries cheese, some rotisserie chicken and a pasta salad.  “I wasn’t sure what you liked, so I guessed.” He said smiling at her magnificent body that he could not wait to take in more ways then one.  He fixed their plates leaving the strawberries for last to be fed to each other. They drank the wine and ate the plates of food. Leaning on his side having her lay next to him he fed her, a strawberry. She bit it off very slowly then she fed him one. He leaned over her turning her on her back kissing her softly, feeling her retuning his advances. He untied her bathing suit top revealing her nice rounded breast. He removed his clothing then removed her bathing suit bottoms. He kissed her then licked her cleavage, slowly running his tongue over her hardened nipples, going down her stomach. He began to perform oral sex on her; he felt her body responding to him. He entered her giving her such pleasures. Her breathing became heavy, his kisses were passionate as well as his touch. He began sucking her air out of her lungs, her eyes opened wide and searching. They were full of fear. She tried to fight him off her, but she could not stop his attack on her. He successfully sucked her dry of oxygen and her soul. He exploded with such an orgasm.  “You were quite a lover my dear.” Whispering in her ear as he raised himself off her dead body. Smiling down at her lying there lifeless, he blasted her to grains of dust. His laughter was sinister and his eyes glowed purple just before he vanished.  Once again, they were too late; they saw the pile of dust. “Damn you Karlen!” Cheyenne cried out for again an innocent person had to die because of evil.  He was truly enjoying torturing the witches for they were unable to stop him again. “Better luck next time ladies.” He said laughing as he vanished from across the street where he stood watching them.  The women went back to the manor again defeated. Cheyenne went to the room opening the book of spells when she found one that might just work. To be able to look through his eyes. She began to chant the spell.  “I Mystic Shadow High Priestess of the white light cast this spell to see through the eyes of the warlock Karlen, preventing another innocent from his evil charm, to prevent them from his harm. Releasing the souls and powers of the ones he has captured.” She chanted when she saw a beautiful woman with long red hair, brown eyes, very built. She was laughing as they were talking.  “I did it! I see his victim!” she yelled as the others came into the room.  “How mother?” Mystic caster asked as her mothers eyes looked strange when she saw the woman he was talking to.  “I cast a spell to see through his eyes. They are going to go out on a date he’s writing down her address quick write down what I tell you.” She told them.” 5854 Yuga way street 8pm tonight Nancy.” She said closing her eyes. “reverse the spell I have just made so I no longer see this vile creatures vision give me back mine making his fade away.” She chanted that when she opened her eyes she was able to see again.  “We should wait until he has her in the bed then we all go in vanquishing him.” Cheyenne told the witches.  At seven o’clock the witches were ready to go, they waited outside of her house as they projected themselves as invisible when they saw him appear at the front door with a dozen roses. They watched them eating dinner, and sipping wine. When dinner was done, they walked into the bedroom, through the shadows on the curtain they could tell they were disrobing then the lights went off.  “Let’s go do it.” Cheyenne told the seven witches.  When they appeared in the room the couple were not in the bed as they expected.  “Surprise you miserable bitches “Karlin told them leaning against the dresser directly behind them. The woman who turned out to be his assistant was standing in front of the door as Karlin began to move towards Mystic Shadow.  “Well if it’s not the bitch Mystic Shadow.” He said with hate for her in his eyes and voice.  The three warlocks showed up with Lightening caster.” Surprise your self asshole.” Fierce caster told him.  Karlin looked at the three warlocks laughing and threw a butcher knife hitting Cheyenne in the chest. She fell to the ground. Murkcaster ran to her as Mystic caster looked at her mother lying there with a knife in her chest.  “Mother! Oh God no!” she cried out seeing her mother laying there.  “Your God can’t save you bitch!” he yelled as he through knives at all the witches using his magic.  “You missed moron!” Mystic caster told him as she began to spin around and around then shooting bolts of lightening at him.  Murkcaster picked up Cheyenne in his arms.” don’t you leave us now.” He told her as they vanished taking her to Aggatha.  Aggatha looked at her beloved grand daughter with the dagger sticking out of her chest.” go the others need you more.” She told him removing the weapon from her heart.  Murkcaster reappeared behind the warlock with the dagger he used to kill Mystic Shadow.” Say good bye asshole.” He told Karlin slitting his throat. The blood poured from his throat then stabbed him in his heart letting him fall to the floor as Mystic caster blew him up. She vanquished him as well making sure he never returned. The other witches turned to his assistant.” You little witch of hell go meet your maker!” Tammy told her blowing her up.  “How is mother?” Mystic caster asked her father with tears in her eyes.  Murkcaster had tears in his eyes, slowly he shooed his head slowly. He tried to speak, but his voice cracked.” She was dead… your grand mother told me to come back here. She was working on her when I left.” He said crying taking his daughter into his arms as they cried together.  The others stood silent not wanting to believe she was gone from them for good. They watched Murkcaster holding his daughter  A tear dropped from fierce caster’s eye. “She has not left us. She has beaten worse then him.” Fierce caster cried out as more tears ran down his face. He vanished to go be with Mystic Shadow.  “Come on let’s go, we did our work here. Let’s go to our fallen sister.” Tammy said as they all disappeared to be with Mystic shadow.  Aggatha was kneeling over Mystic Shadow’s lifeless body and Fierce caster held her running his fingers through her hair softly.  Aggatha was praying for the life to return to her precious grand daughter. “Please don’t let us be too late for her.” She prayed as she had her hands laid on her chest praying for healing. “Oh merciful Higher Power, please give me the power to put the life back into Mystic Shadow’s body with the help of your healing doves.” She said holding her blood soaked hands over Mystic Shadow’s knife wound. Two white doves appeared creating a bright glow around her body and the wound disappeared. “Thank you father.” She said as Mystic Shadow opened her eyes and the doves disappeared.  Mystic caster ran to her mother kneeling next to Fierce caster.” Oh mother, I thought I would never be able to hug you again.” She cried into her mothers arms.  Murkcaster looked away at the sight of Fierce caster holding his wife.” Welcome back Mystic Shadow.” Fierce caster told her smiling with a sparkle in his eyes.  Mystic Shadow smiled up at Fierce caster and her daughter. “I had four great healers.” she smiled looking at Aggatha.

496,496,2822042,0,47,"       Time After Time - by Erotica Writings  Sandy a tall red head, with green eyes, a great boob job from a 32 a to a 42 dd is a 38 year old exotic dancer, thankful that she still looks to be in her late twenties, early thirties she had to keep dancing for one more year then she could quit. Not that stripping hadn’t been good to her; she owns her 2003 black convertible corvette, her condominium over looking Pompano Beach, and has her choice of men every night.  Tonight she is seeing Vinnie a sixty year old man who is married with three grown son’s all lawyers and kept Sandy in the family. She would laughing tell her room mate Cher that she was their families whore. She slipped into a black lace thong, with matching push up bra, a black lace garter belt that held up her tanned hose. She slipped into a short black dinner dress that exposed most of her breast, six inch black spiked heels. Her phone rang it was Vinnie letting her know he was there.  Sandy walked up to the black limo and climbed into the back seat with Vinnie who sat with his erection out of his pants. She smiled getting on her knees between his legs on the floor of the limo and she began to perfume oral sex on him, his hardened erection softly pressed against her lips, her tongue slowly went up and down the shaft and all around the head, his hands were in her bra caressing her breast, then roughly he shoved her head down making his erection going further in her mouth until he oozed his hot thick juices down her throat.  He zipped up his pants after replacing him self back in his pants. “One hundred and I will see you when I return.” He told her handing the money and sent her on her way. She looked around at the street.  “Shit! He dropped me two miles from home.” She said to her self walking into a small bar to call for a cab and a drink to remove his taste from her mouth.” Could I have a whiskey sour and a cab please.” She asked the blond female bartender wearing a poor imitation of a playboy bunny’s outfit.  “Sure thing.” She said with a smile.  A drunken man in his thirties sat next to her. He placed his hand on her knee.” Where have you been all night beautiful?” he asked her leaning closer to her.  She smiled at him. “Oh I have been giving head for a hundred bucks.” She told him running her tongue over her teeth slowly.  The man with brown short hair, blue eyes that held a red glare looked at her swaying in his seat. “A hundred bucks huh? You going to buy the drinks then?” he asked her trying to hold his eyes open.  She couldn’t help but to laugh at him. “Sure I’ll buy you a drink.” She told him ordering him a drink.  “Your ok, I don’t care what anyone says about you, your alright with me. Hey someone told me you were giving head for a hundred bucks! I didn’t believe them.” He said shaking his head.  She giggled slightly noticing that if he wasn’t so drunk he’d be cute. “I told you that about me.” She told him.  “Exactly and I don’t believe it, I got to see it to believe it, want to show me?” He asked her almost falling off the bar stool.  “Well my cab is here, have a good evening.” She told him getting up to leave the bar.  “I am going with you, your buying the drinks remember.” He said following her out to the cab.  He pushed her in the cab and then fell in behind her. “Damn girl move over.” He told her trying to get straightened up in the back seat. “You want to kiss me?” he asked her with half opened eyes.  “No, not really, do you have a hundred and I will kiss you.” She said smiling at him.  “No not really.” He told her taking a deep breath.  She noticed the cab driver began going in the opposite direction. ”driver your going the wrong way.” She told him.  The driver an oriental man shrugged his shoulders and kept driving and he drove faster. She tried to open the door but they were locked. She could not get to him because of the metal mesh guard.” stop this car and let us out.” She yelled at him.  “Hey you heard her let us out of here!” the drunken man yelled punching the mesh guard. The cab driver just kept driving until he pulled in front of an eerie looking mansion.  A huge bald man opened the cab door to let the couple out and paid the driver who left. “Follow me.” He told them without any type of expression on his face.  “Why should we?” she asked grateful that she was not alone.  “I am taking you to Mr. Cadrula’s private party.” He told them.  The drunken man was all for this. ”Hell yes lets party!” He told them following them into the house smiling.  Sandy looked around feeling a little scared, they entered a room where there were naked people sitting around drinking. A very handsome man approached them naked. “Please disrobe and join in on the festivities.” He told them smiling at Sandy. ”Join me for a drink dear?” he asked Sandy  “Sure.” She said removing her dress and feeling strange being nude in front of him.  He smiled at her body. “We are going to have a great time he told her taking her to a secluded couch in the corner.  The drunken man was led to a tall blonde where he began to enjoy him self hugging on the woman laying his head on her large breast. Sandy felt like she was under a weird spell and could not resist him as he kissed her lips, he poured her a green drink and began running his hands over her breast, her vision was becoming blurred.  ” I feel strange.” She told him as she looked for the drunken man, she saw him laid back on the couch a sleep. Mr. Cadrula began licking her neck as he massaged her breast, he laid her down on the couch and performed oral sex on her until she filled his mouth of hot juices. She had never been with a man who could pleasure her better then her room mate Cher. She felt him enter her with his hard erection, he felt so good, he made love to her slowly until they both came in a powerful orgasm and she felt him bite into her neck until she past out.  When she woke up the next morning she was in the drunken mans arm. She still felt strange from last night. She noticed the man was looking at her. “How long have you been awake?” she asked him.  He smiled at her. “Long enough to wish I had a hundred.” He told her.  “So you remember huh?” she asked smiling.  “I remember everything about you and the big blond that blew my mind so to speak and then bit the hell out of my neck.” He said rubbing his neck.  “He bit me too.” She said remembering the strange handsome man. “Where is everyone?” she asked looking around.  “They fucked like rabbits and left just before sunrise,” he told her beginning to kiss her mouth.  She found him attractive sober and returned his kisses. Maybe it was some side effect of the weird drink the man gave her because she was hungry for sex and straddled him; he entered her body slowly caressing her breast as she moved in a slow circular motion, she began sucking his fingers one at a time, he placed his hands on her hips taking her deeper and harder when she began moaning from the pleasure of his hard erection until they both erupted into hot orgasms one after another.  She collapsed on top of him breathing heavily when she noticed blood running from his bite wounds and felt a warm liquid seeping from hers. She touched her neck and looked at the red liquid on her finger tips. She lay next to him, still staring at her bloody finger tips when sleep had over come the two new lovers.  Hours had passed as they slept peacefully side by side when they were awakened by the large bald man. He led them to a room that was upstairs where he drew their baths for them to cleanse themselves. Sandy looked at her new friend bewildered. ”what is your name?” she asked him soaking in the tub as he shaved over the bathroom sink.  He smiled at her.” Tim, Tim Jenkins and you are who?” he asked shaving his neck.  “My name is Sandy Lewis.” She told him washing her arms with the large white bath sponge. “I need to get to work soon.” She said finishing washing.  “What do you do?” Tim asked her watching how sensual she made a bath look.  She smiled at him. “I am an exotic dancer and private escort.” She told him.  “Ah so you were giving head for a hundred.” He said feeling almost a sadness hearing how she makes a living. “Well I need to get going to, I have to feed Fred.” He told her watching her step out of the tub.  She wrapped the large white towel around her.” Who is Fred?” she asked him walking to the large bed in the other room, she noticed there weren’t any mirrors in the bedroom just the small hand held that Tim used to shave with.  “Fred’s my dog, I imagine he is pretty pist and hungry.” He told her drawing bath water to bathe in.  The bedroom door opened and the large bald man brought in clothes for them to put on. Sandy looked at the clothing,” These aren’t our clothing.” She told him fingering the articles of clothing.  “Compliments of Mr. Cadrula Miss. Lewis.” He told her without an ounce of emotion running through his veins.  “How do you know my name?” she asked him looking weary at him.  “You told Mr. Cadrula last night.” He told her and left the room.  Sandy looked bewildered her memory of last night was blurred and the wound on her neck kept seeping blood, she found some gauze in the bath room and doctored their necks. She noticed they both had two puncture wounds. “I think someone was drinking our blood.” She told him jokingly.  “Nothing would surprise me, man I am hungry lets go eat.” He told her rubbing her stomach.  “Cute, very cute.” She told him smiling at him being silly.  TRILOGY 2  Time After Time   The two new friends walked out of the door and hadn’t any recollection of being in this hall, their minds were in a fog like state. At the table there were other people sitting around the table eating and drinking. The butler handed them both a thick red drink. Sandy looked at the drink as strangely as Tim did thinking how much it looked like Blood. They felt forced to drink the drink and once they had they woke up the next morning in bed together again.  “Tim what happened?” Sandy asked seeing he did not look well.  “Man I don’t know, I feel like someone wrecked my pecker and tried to saw off my neck.” he said wiping his hand over his bloody neck.  “Oh my you are bleeding badly.” She said running to the bathroom when she looked into the hand held mirror noticing that her eyes had black rings around them like Tim’s and her neck and naked body was covered in blood. Her head began to spin as she stumbled back to the bed.  “We have to get out of here they are killing us.” She told him wiping the tears away from her eyes that were swollen.  The bedroom door opened and there was the butler with clean clothes again for them. Without a word they began to dress with out an ounce of emotion. Again they drank the thick red drink and again they woke up together this time in each others arms feeling quite strange and horny. Sandy straddled Tim roughly pinning his arms back over his head and began to kiss and lick him as she felt his hard cock going deep inside of her hot wet pussy and they began fucking each other hard and furious until the climax changed their eyes to bright purple and fangs grew from their mouths. And now the hunt for fresh food was going to begin.  Sandy and Tim ran out into the darkness of the night when they spotted` the limo carrying Vinnie's two sons and Sandy knew they had scored their food on her own customer son's. They appeared inside the limo looking at the terrified men wondering who and what these two creatures were, before they could say a word Sandy and Tim were biting into the necks of their victims drinking their blood until they were quite full. They vanished from inside the limo before the driver had reached his destination with Vinnie's sons. As Tim and Sandy walked down the road arm in arm Sandy wanted to bring Cher back to the mansion.  Cher was sound to sleep in her warm bed when Tim and Sandy joined her and Sandy woke her up by giving her oral sex. Cher was excited to find her long lost room mate and friend in her bed, Tim began kissing her until his mouth was near her neck and lightly sank his fangs into her neck.  'Son-of-a-bitch your biting my neck!' Cher yelled out before everything went black.  Cher woke up the next morning with a sore neck and felt so drowsy from her friends visit to her room. She looked around and saw Sandy and Tim dressing like they were going to a ball. She then realized she was not in her room, the clock said six o’clock.  “Its six in the morning where are you going?” She asked clearing her throat that hurt.  “Its dinner time, not breakfast Cher, here is a dress and things for you.” Sandy told her smiling.  “What is going on Sandy and why do you look so strange?” she asked looking at Sandy through squinted eyes.  “We are giving you a gift to live forever like we have been given.” Sandy told her friend.  Cher looked around shaking her head as she felt the wounds on her neck were still bleeding. Cher quickly jumped from the bed and on top of Sandy.  “You bitch who asked you to turn me into some fucking freak?” she yelled pounding on Sandy with her fist.  Sandy became enraged and flew Cher into the wall with all of her power. Just then the door opened slowly as everything went black for Cher. When Cher finally came to she was in strange room chained to a wall with cuff’s and shackles, it felt as if a ball had been wedged into her mouth. Her eyes showed the fear surging through her veins and then she saw him, Mr. Cardell made her feel calm and she loved it when he placed nipple clamps on her nipples smiling the whole time and then placed his thumb on her clit that became alive with juices from his touch, she felt as if she was becoming like a wild animal wanting to mate with him. He held the thick red drink to her lips and slowly gave her sips through his seduction.  Cher felt warm and tingled all over, she felt him turning her so her back would be to him and her hips began swaying in a slow circular motion and then she let out a blood curdling scream as he rammed his cock up her ass.  “Tell me I am your Master bitch!” he whispered so evilly in her ear.  “Yes you’re my master!” she screamed as tears formed in her eyes for his cock was swelling and becoming so freezing cold it actually felt like fire.  His eyes began to glow and everyone stood watching him fucking her and the veins in his body were actually throbbing under his flesh, his fangs grew and then he plunged them into her neck at the exact same time he came so hard and deep in her ass. Once more Cher welcomed the blackness that helped her to escape.  Cher opened her eyes slowly finding herself strapped to a metal table with a gag in her mouth. She could hear laughter coming from the next room and then recognized Sandy’s laughter. “ Bitch.” Cher thought to herself. Then she saw him emerge into the room, she could not help this attraction she had for him, she felt herself becoming very wet in this black latex outfit she found herself dressed in.  “Good evening my new pet.” he said smiling down at her lightly touching her cheek.  “evening? I slept all day?” she asked noticing the glass in his hand that he brought to her lips and she drank without any questions for she was so thirsty.  He placed the gag back in her mouth and she noticed the room filling up with people and she could make Sandy and her new fuck standing smiling at her. He began connecting wires to her nipples, and clit and then she felt electricity going through her. She screamed and he laughed as he placed two fingers inside of her pussy and sucked on her breast slightly and each time he stopped she received an electrical shock.  She found herself becoming horny and each scream she noticed an excitement in his eyes which made her even wetter and her juices were flowing. She noticed that the others were getting turned on and pleasuring each other as they watched her being tortured by this man she was becoming so hot for.  “Mmmm please fuck me Mr. Cardula.” She asked him as her body was squirming from the shocking fore play he was delivering to her body parts.  “Not yet.” He said in a disinterested voice and sent electrical shocks through her again.  Her body wanted him and her mind was becoming part of his as she arched her hips upward towards the ceiling and screamed loudly until his mouth was over hers and his hands roamed her body slowly lingering on her nipples as he twisted and pinched them when she caught a glimpse of his hard erection.  “Master please let me suck your cum that I so desperately wish to drink down my throat.” She begged him.  “Not yet.” he told her playing with her clit between his thumb and index finger teasing her and driving her wild with the desire to explode into a huge orgasm and sent more electrical shock waves through her pussy and nipples.  His erection was pulsating with the desire to fuck her senseless and he mounted her taking her roughly and her screams turned into loud moans of pleasure as he fucked her pussy so hard and so wild and as he planted his sperm deep with in her he finished turning her into a creature of the night with the third bite into her wounds. Blackness embraced Cher once again.  None of the other creatures of the night noticed the tall blonde male with his partner with long brown hair, both men wore all black and carried large stakes with them………   Time After Time  *CONCLUSION*  The whole mansion was involved in a huge orgy when the two men stumbled upon the creatures of the night and without a word they were killing the unsuspecting creatures with their stakes burying them deep into their hearts causing them to explode in balls of flame that vanished into thin air. Sandy, Cher and Tim saw what was happening to the others as Mr. Cardula exploded in a ball of fire the three were able to vanish before they men could get to them. In the night air they flew as large bats with the other handful that was able to escape the clutches of the slayers.  They flew most of the night until they came to an old run down mansion. They all looked at each other wondering why they were led to this place and what led them?  “Why are we here?” Cher asked looking around at the cob webs.  “I don’t know, it was like a magnet was drawing us here.“ Tim said looking around at the eerie place when he heard laughter coming from the house.  “ What have you dragged us into Sandy?” Cher asked as she slapped Sandy across her head.  “Why did you slap me for?” Sandy asked rubbing her head.  “You got me into this, now I am a blood sucking freak and its all your fault.” she cried.  “Shit, You bitched that I never included you into anything and when I do you fucking Complain.” Sandy yelled feeling so frustrated with Cher.  “Fuck you Sandy.” Cher yelled as the others began walking into the house.  There were people having sex all over the place, women and men bound to chairs and tables as the others were dripping hot wax on their body parts, some were being electrocuted while some were cuffed and shackled by chains while they were being spanked.  Cher saw him and smiled so big as she hurried to be by his side. He turned slowly and then she saw how grotesque his face was and horns sticking out of his head. He grabbed her by the wrist and no matter how hard she tried she could not escape from his hold on her. He threw her on the large table, ripping her clothes off of her and then he was between her thighs squeezing her breast with his long wrinkled hands that had long razor type nails and entered her pussy with his large hard cock that felt so cold it burnt her pussy. She was turned on by this wicked sex and ground her hips with him as Sandy and Tim were busy drinking the blood mixtures that Mr. Cardula always served at his parties. They were not even aware that they had been blown into hell with the others that night and would be condemned to this hells house.

499,499,2822042,0,47,"       Seduced By An Entity Ch. 08 by Erotica_Writings ©  Once Hank was gone from the house Gore warrior read the deed learning where she was. He began laughing because he would be there before Hank when he heard Cheyenne summons him.” why is she sending for me?” he asked himself as he vanished.  Gore warrior materialized in Cheyenne’s bedroom at the other house. “Why are you summoning me Cheyenne?” he asked looking at her lying so beautiful in the bed.  “Are you not my master? Am I not your queen? Do we not share a son together who is in my stomach growing into a great warrior?” she asked looking seductively to throw him off track so that the others who were waiting to help destroy him.”  “You remember our union then?” he said going to the bed to where she laid.  “Yes Gore warrior I remember how you tricked me into being your queen.” She told him smiling up at him.  “Then you know you belong to me now and will serve me as your master.” He said lying next to her rubbing her stomach where their child laid protected from harm.  “Yes I do know.” She told him as she got out of the bed.  “Come back here and pleasure me now.” He ordered.  “No I do not feel like having your hands touching me ever again.” She told him turning to face him seeing the confusion on his face turning to anger as he realized she was going to blow him up when she doubled over grabbing her stomach in severe pain she dropped to her knees.” Oh my God my son! What is happening? “She asked as the pain became so severe she was crying.” Help me somebody, help me!” she yelled out as the pain was intolerable.  Gore warrior out of fear of losing his child’s life picked Cheyenne up in his arms laying her on the bed.  ” No this cannot be happening not now.” he said as Cheyenne laid in a ball on the bed with sever stomach cramps.  “Get Aggatha quickly or our son will parish.” She said crying, as the pain was intolerable.   Aggatha came to Cheyenne seeing her in pain she vanished to bring the doctor back. In a matter of minutes the doctor was there beside her.” Here drink this potion it will stop the pain. Gore warrior please leave the room.” She asked.  “No not when my son’s life is in jeopardy.” He said.  “Your presence is upsetting Cheyenne which is causing the pain.” The doctor told him.  Gore warrior left the room as the three began to whisper so he could not hear them.” The child is keeping you from killing his father. His death will have to wait until the child is born or loose the child.” The doctor told her.  Fredrick stood beside her bed.” it will have to wait since you’re the only one powerful enough to destroy him.” He told her sadly.  Aggatha tell Gore warrior to come here Fredrick disappear. ” Cheyenne said as the pain was easing.  “How is our son?” he asked her.  “Fine and if you want him to stay that way you must leave me alone until his birth, that means I do not want you anywhere around me .” she told him.  This angered Gore warrior as he grabbed her throat to strangle her.  ” Do not try and keep me from my son or I will kill you.” He told her looking more of a demon now then ever before.  Cheyenne sent him into the wall so hard with one swipe of her hand.” do not fuck with me Gore warrior or I will forget you are my son’s father. As far as any union you tricked me by getting me drunk and I do not recognize it.” She told him as he picked himself up off the floor.  “Your mine and you will be coming with me when our son is born.” He told her looking at her,” I will leave but the day of the birth I will return.” He said as he vanished from the house.  Cheyenne lay in the bed rubbing her stomach.” why must you keep me from destroying him my child? He will only destroy us and all that is good.” She said as she rubbed her stomach as Fredrick appeared beside her bed.” Fredrick why is the child protecting Gore warrior?” she asked her new comrade.  “Do not forget Cheyenne not only are you carrying a child that is part of you but of Gore warrior as well and that makes him warlock & demon.” He smiled as he looked at Cheyenne laying there so lovely just as her mother had many years ago.” it almost saddens me to look at you for you are your mothers image.” He told her becoming misty eyed.  “You loved her didn’t you?” She asked him seeing for the first time softness about Fredrick.  “We were lover’s Cheyenne and she became pregnant with my child, we were going to leave but then greed and power possessed me and I chose the dark side. Your mother could not give up her belief in the good she worked so hard for. So we went our own way. She met Murk shadow and he took her with the child as his. Your mother Charmelmystic named our daughter Mystic shadow after her and him. Mean while I became more evil with more power and went back to claim what was mine. Of course, she denied me and even tried to fight me, but out of anger I blasted her and the others killing them on the spot, they had placed their children and my daughter somewhere that I could not find them for protection, but I found them. I tried to destroy them, but it was I who was destroyed by my own man.” he looked at her waiting for a response from her.  “You’re my father , you raped me, you gave me to Gore warrior that night and you dare stand in front of me now?!” she asked feeling the anger grow inside of her.” I should send you to a place so barren for the rest of eternity. Why did you do that to me for?” she asked as tears ran down her face.  Fredrick looked at her seeing the pain but she had to know.” I had become mad Cheyenne remember I went completely demonic mating with ones family member was not uncommon, just unholy.” he told her.” you have my blood flowing through your body which makes you the powerful witch you are today. Just use it the right way and don’t give into the temptations of more power that will come your way.”  Cheyenne in total disbelief.” I find out I am bound to Gore warrior, carrying his child, I find out you are my father, what is going to come next?” she asked  “Aggatha is your grandmother.' He told her.” she came with me as she watched me slaughter my whole family but she worked for me to keep me from you and I never knew for a moment she was a traitor, spy whatever you want to call her.” He explained to her as he floated from window to window.  Through her tears she looked at him.” anything else that has been hidden from me?” she asked afraid to hear if there was.  “No Cheyenne just use your knowledge to work for you for both of your parents were very powerful warriors as well as your stepfather.” He told her regretting the choices he had made in life.  Aggatha came to the door seeing Cheyenne crying.” you told her everything didn’t you Fredrick?” she asked him. “In death you become righteous?” She asked disgusted by him. ”someone wishes to see you Cheyenne.”  “Who wants to see me?” she asked as she wiped her eyes.  “I do Cheyenne, I want to see you.” Hank said standing in the door way.  Cheyenne looked at Hank.” Why so you may burn us at the stakes?” she asked him as her mind reeled with mixed emotions.  “I have regretted telling you that Cheyenne. I came here to tell you that I love you and want to raise the child as mine.” He told her coming to the bed.” I can’t live without you Cheyenne you’re my world without you in it, it does not revolve.” He told her sitting on the bed next to her kissing her hand.  Cheyenne began laughing. ”History is repeating it self father.” She told Frederick.  “Who are you talking to Cheyenne?” he asked as he could not see Frederick standing there as he was ghost.  “Show your self to him father.” She told Frederick.  When Hank saw Frederick standing there he was shocked.” He is your father?” he asked in disbelief.  “Oh there’s more I just found out, Aggatha is my grandmother, and Gore warrior is my child’s father and I am bound to him in a UN holy union. And our marriage is not recognized in the supernatural world.” She told him breaking down into tears.  He took her in his arms holding her.” you’re my wife no matter who recognizes it. You and I are bound in holy union and I am not leaving.” He told her as she cried in his arms.  “My child will not let me destroy his father. “ She told him crying in his arms as a child.  “Cheyenne you must pull your self together in order for this to work out or history will repeat itself completely.” Frederick told her.  “I know, I know and I will.” She told him rolling her eyes at him.  “Until we get things cleared up with Gore warrior Hank you should sleep in another room so we do not infuriate him any more since he has claimed Cheyenne as his.” Aggatha told him.  “I will do what ever it takes, just as long as Cheyenne loves me.” He told her.  “I love you Hank.” She told him. ”oh one more thing my real name is Mystic Shadow.” She told him.  “I will stick with the name Cheyenne.” he said as he kissed her.  “I will show you to your room.” Aggatha told him.  That night as Cheyenne slept soundly Gore warrior stood over her. He had silver dusk standing next to him, his female seductress that he used for his pleasures. “Make your self look like Cheyenne go to the mortal Hanks room and seduce him, then in time you will talk him into giving his soul to us.” He said smiling at her.  Silver dusk walked quietly to Hanks room where he slept in his bed, she slid into the bed next to him as she began to kiss him so lightly, and Hank woke up seeing Cheyenne next to him.” Cheyenne should you be in here?” he asked as she slid her hand into his pajama bottoms.” I need love Hank.” She told him as she felt him responding to her touch. She slid the night gown off of her then straddled him as she began to ride him slowly; he kissed her lips, as he caressed her breast. As she began to get him to get more into the seduction she cast a spell over him and turned back into her natural form of long black hair, blue eyes, her body was voluptuous and he was falling more into the spell deeper and deeper as his passion grew.” Give your soul to me to own Hank and you can have me forever.” She said rubbing her breast as he was being drained from her.  Before Hank could answer Fredrick appeared breaking her spell.  ” Hank come out of it or you will be doomed”. Fredrick’s voice boomed startling Hank.  “what the hell?” he asked knocking the woman to the ground where she vanished.” who was that?” Hank asked jumping out of bed.  “Gore warrior knows you’re here and that is his mistress she was going to have your soul if I hadn’t stopped you two.” Frederick told him.” Go to Cheyenne I am sure Gore warrior is there.”  Hank ran to the room where he found Gore warrior standing over Cheyenne.” get away from her!” he yelled  Cheyenne woke up seeing him by her bed using her powers sent Gore warrior out the window.  Hank explained to her about the woman and Frederick saving him in time. Cheyenne knew they would have to go where he and the others would be safe. She had Hank stay in her room that night to protect him from what ever else Gore warrior had planned for him.  Aggatha and Frederick convinced Cheyenne where ever she goes he’ll find her. They arranged for each one to take turns watching over the others while they slept when they were the most vulnerable.  “Six months later…”  “I am so huge!” Cheyenne said looking at herself in the mirror wearing a blue jean maternity dress. Her stomach was protruding, her hair turned back to dark brown.” I can not wait to have this child or the Good Year blimp is going to be jealous.” She joked with Tammy.  “Cheyenne what are we going to do when the time comes?” she asked fearful of the out come after the child’s birth.  “We are going to pray everything comes out ok for all of us.” She told her looking very serious when she noticed Gina listening at the door.” Gina what are you doing?” she asked the young girl.  “Nothing Cheyenne, I was just standing here! Everyone only cares about that stupid baby!” she said looking at her stomach with such an evil look.  “We care about you too Gina.” She told her walking up to her and pinching her cheek.  Not thinking.” I can’t wait until we are together with my daddy.” She said smiling up at Cheyenne.  “Your daddy?” Cheyenne asked the young girl wondering what she meant.  “Yes he is my daddy too not just the dumb baby’s.” She told Cheyenne hating the child she was carrying and then went flying into the wall so hard it knocked her unconscious.  “Who did that?” Tammy asked looking around.  “I think the baby did, I felt it kick when she went flying.” Cheyenne told her as she tried to help to revive the child.  That night as everyone slept Cheyenne snuck down to the kitchen where she found a package of raw liver. She was licking her lips as she removed it and placed it on a plate. As she sat down at the table she grabbed the meat with her hands as she began to devour it. Suddenly Aggatha knocked it out of her hand.” Stop it Cheyenne! You have to fight those cravings! The cravings are a demonic nature to eat raw bloody meat.” She told her holding her shoulders.  Cheyenne began to cry. ” Maybe I should just go to him and give in Aggatha.” She said as she looked at the raw meat and couldn’t believe she was eating it.” What have I done to all of us?” she cried feeling so lost and weak from her pregnancy.  Aggatha looked so sad remembering when her own daughter went through this.” The baby will come out like us my dear you will see.”  Aggatha told her with a smile hoping to convince Cheyenne that everything would work out, but she also tried to convince her self.  Cheyenne went back to her room she heard Gina talking to someone, she opened the door to find Gore warrior sitting on her bed.” get away from her!” she ordered him.” You were told not to come back here ever again!” she yelled as a hard wind began to blow in the room, Cheyenne feeling her anger rage and threw a lightening bolt at him.  Gore warrior moved out of its path before it could hit him.” Stop or I will kill your mortal husband who you have been keeping house with here!” he yelled.” My daughter keeps me well informed on you Mystic Shadow.” He told her calling her by her birth name from her parents.  “You little traitor!” Cheyenne snarled at the child who hid behind Gore warrior from Cheyenne’s Wrath that she had never seen before.  “You enjoy your time with the mortal one, but just remember the day the child is born you are coming with me where we are going to rule the Dark Side.” He told her as his eyes glowed.  Cheyenne stood there looking at him when Gina stepped out from behind him looking at him.” I am the Princess of Darkness I am the one who will rule the Dark Side not you and Cheyenne.” She told him.  He looked at the child angrily.” Now that the Prince of darkness is coming into the world you will be his servant and that’s all.” He told her pushing her to the ground.  Gina became outraged as she looked at Cheyenne’s stomach as she grabbed a pair of scissors running at Cheyenne to stab her in order to kill the baby when Gore warrior made the girl rise into the air then placing her in his hand by holding her up by the neck.” I will kill you; you little bitch if you even go near him or my queen ever again.” He growled as his face turned demonic.  “Stop it let her go! She is just a child!”   ” Cheyenne cried running to him to save Gina from him.  Gore warrior laughed awakening the whole house.” As you wish my queen.” He said dropping the child onto floor where she cried out from the pain.  “You bastard!” she yelled running to check on Gina.  Everyone was at the bedroom door the seven other women stood directly behind Cheyenne.  ” Leave here now.” She ordered him as her face almost looked like stone and hate raged from her eyes.  Gore warrior vanished as Cheyenne held the child crying into her arms. “Someone needs to stay in here at night with her.”  Gloria took the child from Cheyenne.” I will stay Cheyenne.” She told her holding Gina in her arms.  That night Cheyenne dreamt she was in a grave yard, the fog was thick making it hard for her to see where she was walking when she felt hands coming out of the graves grabbing at her feet and legs trying to drag her in to them. Cheyenne was screaming as she tried to get away from them when she ran into Gore warrior.” Why do you fight everything Cheyenne?” he asked as he walked towards her.  “Stay away from me.” She told him as she tried using her magic to make him disappear.  “It doesn’t work here in the dream world Cheyenne we are both with out the use of our magic here.” He said pulling her up to his strong masculine body as he touched her stomach with his hand.” You know I will not let you raise him without being by my side,” he told her looking into her eyes.  “I don’t love you Gore warrior why would I want to spend eternity with you?” She asked him, his face was only from hers.  “You would learn to love me as you love the son we made together.” He told her almost in a whisper close to her ear.” I brought you here to talk to you my love.” He said kissing her neck softly.  “No Gore warrior stop it!” she pleaded knowing she was helpless against him.  “Our son wants us together do you not care what he wants?” he asked her as he pressed his body up against hers rubbing his hands along her back. He could feel she was fighting the temptation of his touch.  “Stop Gore warrior you will hurt the child inside of me.” She pleaded wishing she could wake up.  He caressed her breast, his lips softly kissing her neck, to her breast, taking her to the ground with him; he had her on top of him as he made love to her. He broke through her resistance to him. Giving into the temptation and lust, he made her feel.  After they were finished he smiled up at her.” We will be so powerful together Mystic Shadow.  “No I will not go with you Gore warrior.” She told him firmly.  “Then you will live without our son Mystic Shadow.” He said pushing her down on the ground where the hands began to grab at her pulling her down into the graves as he laughed at her screams. Hank was shaking Cheyenne trying to get her to wake up as she was screaming in her sleep. “Baby wake up it’s a dream.” He was telling her as everyone ran into her room.  “He has her in the dream world where she is helpless I have to go save her.” Aggatha told them just as Tammy threw cold water from a pitcher on her forcing Cheyenne out of her sleep.  “I should have thought of that one.” Aggatha said.  Cheyenne shot up in the bed soaked from the pitcher of water gasping for air as she looked around the room as everyone watched fearing for her safety. ” He had me in the dream world where our powers were non existent, he tried to seduce me and succeeded, I was helpless to his advances, the temptation and lust!” she cried.       ",4999,1000,Seduced By An Entity Ch by Erotica_Writings Once Hank was gone from the house Gore warrior read the deed learning where she was He began laughing because he would be there before Hank when he heard Cheyenne summons him why is she sending for me he asked himself as he vanished Gore warrior materialized in Cheyenne’s bedroom at the other house Why are you summoning me Cheyenne he asked looking at her lying so beautiful in the bed Are you not my master Am I not your queen Do we not share a son together who is in my stomach growing into a great warrior she asked looking seductively to throw him off track so that the others who were waiting to help destroy him You remember our union then he said going to the bed to where she laid Yes Gore warrior I remember how you tricked me into being your queen She told him smiling up at him Then you know you belong to me now and will serve me as your master He said lying next to her rubbing her stomach where their child laid protected from harm Yes I do know She told him as she got out of the bed Come back here and pleasure me now He ordered No I do not feel like having your hands touching me ever again She told him turning to face him seeing the confusion on his face turning to anger as he realized she was going to blow him up when she doubled over grabbing her stomach in severe pain she dropped to her knees Oh my God my son What is happening She asked as the pain became so severe she was crying Help me somebody help me she yelled out as the pain was intolerable Gore warrior out of fear of losing his child’s life picked Cheyenne up in his arms laying her on the bed No this cannot be happening not now he said as Cheyenne laid in a ball on the bed with sever stomach cramps Get Aggatha quickly or our son will parish She said crying as the pain was intolerable Aggatha came to Cheyenne seeing her in pain she vanished to bring the doctor back In a matter of minutes the doctor was there beside her Here drink this potion it will stop the pain Gore warrior please leave the room She asked No not when my son’s life is in jeopardy He said Your presence is upsetting Cheyenne which is causing the pain The doctor told him Gore warrior left the room as the three began to whisper so he could not hear them The child is keeping you from killing his father His death will have to wait until the child is born or loose the child The doctor told her Fredrick stood beside her bed it will have to wait since you’re the only one powerful enough to destroy him He told her sadly Aggatha tell Gore warrior to come here Fredrick disappear Cheyenne said as the pain was easing How is our son he asked her Fine and if you want him to stay that way you must leave me alone until his birth that means I do not want you anywhere around me she told him This angered Gore warrior as he grabbed her throat to strangle her Do not try and keep me from my son or I will kill you He told her looking more of a demon now then ever before Cheyenne sent him into the wall so hard with one swipe of her hand do not fuck with me Gore warrior or I will forget you are my son’s father As far as any union you tricked me by getting me drunk and I do not recognize it She told him as he picked himself up off the floor Your mine and you will be coming with me when our son is born He told her looking at her I will leave but the day of the birth I will return He said as he vanished from the house Cheyenne lay in the bed rubbing her stomach why must you keep me from destroying him my child He will only destroy us and all that is good She said as she rubbed her stomach as Fredrick appeared beside her bed Fredrick why is the child protecting Gore warrior she asked her new comrade Do not forget Cheyenne not only are you carrying a child that

506,506,2822042,0,47,"       Seduced By An Entity Ch. 23 by Erotica_Writings © Jada Crystal cast a spell so no one could read her thoughts and the ones they did read were the ones that she implanted so no one would know what she was up to. As she entered, the room to work out she noticed no one was around, she summoned Doom caster a massive black warrior who was bald, his build was muscular, and his body hard and firm. She transformed herself into looking like Mystic Shadow looking at the huge man when he came into the room. She would not only cause trouble for Mystic Shadow, but also have fun at the same time. She walked up to him smiling. 'I was wondering if you would work out with me?' she asked him looking at his body in the new white work out suits.  'I would be honored.' he told her smiling.  I think we should try wresting moves.' she told him as he would have to be in contact with each others bodies.  She allowed him to pin her down on the floor; he was on top of her becoming aroused looking at her breast. While he had her down, she was able to maneuver her body so she was sitting on top of him. Holding his arms back over his head leaning over him as her breast touched his face. She moved her body feeling him getting an erection then kissing him softly. He returned her kisses, she allowed him to touch her breast, and she sat straight up on top of him moving her body sexually with her eyes closed.  'Take me now.' She told him through her powers they both were nude, he entered her thinking it was with Mystic Shadow.  After they had reached their climax she smiled for he never suspected it was not Mystic Shadow.' You can go now.' She told him as they both dressed.  He looked at her strangely. 'Will I see you again?' he asked taking her hand kissing it softly.  She smiled at him smugly. 'Don't be ridiculous. ' She told him and vanished.  That night while everyone was sleeping, she slipped into Roger's room as he slept soundly; sitting on the edge of the bed, she woke him. 'Knight Shadow.' She whispered into his ear.  When he woke up he saw her sitting there in a white satin night gown with a white satin lacing criss crossing from her breast to her navel.' is something wrong?' he asked as he looked at her, she was so beautiful he thought.  'I couldn't sleep.' she told him leaning over kissing him.  By her kiss, he knew it was not Mystic Shadow, but that it was actually Jada caster.  'Well now that you woke me up I can't either.' he told her taking her in his arms, kissing her passionately, he had never kissed Jada caster with so much feeling and love. His hands roamed over her body, he took her with such force, such passion. 'I love you Mystic Shadow.' He whispered in her ear. Then he became rougher, violent in the bed  She began to feel scared. 'Stop your hurting me!' she yelled as he continued the assault.  He looked her in the eye.' That is how cheap vile whores like it!' he yelled at her.  She looked at him in shock when the door opened and Mystic Shadow stood there in disbelief with Murkcaster, ' what is going on in here?' she asked as she heard the yelling and her own voice coming from the room.  Knight Shadow grabbed his robe as he quickly jumped out of the bed.' You have a Judas!' He told Mystic Shadow causing Jada caster's spell to break revealing her identity to them.  Mystic Shadow looked at her confused, hurt without saying a word tears fell down her face. She felt her heart break by the hurt caused by the woman she thought of as a sister. She ran down the hall to her bedroom throwing her self on the bed. She cried over the loss of her sister.  Murkcaster knew she was in pain and made Jada caster feel Mystic Shadow's pain, he let her see her crying the tears of sorrow on her bed.  Jada Caster holding her finger tips over her mouth with tears filling her eyes like pools. 'Oh God what have I done?' she cried realizing that she had created something in her head that did not exist. 'May I please go to her?' she asked Murkcaster.  'No, you have done enough damage for now.' he told her walking away.  Guardian caster appeared.' come with me child, we must cleanse your body, and soul of the evil you allowed to enter it, her name is called envy.' She told her.  'I have to tell her I am sorry.' She told Guardian caster crying.  They decided it was best to keep this all a secret from the others and hope the month of cleansing, oils, healing potions would restore Jada caster.  The next day Mystic Shadow was working out when Doom caster came in while she was there. Looking at her body, he remembered how her body made him feel and he wanted her again.  'Want company today?' he asked lusting over her body.  'No thank you I am finished.' She told him getting up and leaving.  He became angered feeling used 'now I am not even good enough for her royal highness to talk to!' he said to himself throwing punches at the wall.' I have plans for you!' he said looking at the door angrily.  He cast a spell that the next time they were alone she would become unconscious so he could kidnap her.' I'll teach you!' he said a loud.  The next day he waited until he saw her enter the work out room he followed her in when she saw him behind her she fainted into his arms and they disappeared.  He took her to an abandoned castle keeping her in the dungeon he used a potion that rendered her powers useless. She was chained to a bed where he woke her as they both lay in the bed.' I woke you because I want you awake when I take what you gave to me willingly yesterday.' He told her touching her body.  'That wasn't me! It was Jada caster! She was caught last night and sent for cleansing.' she told him trying to use her powers, but they were gone. 'Oh God help me please.' She cried as he forced her to kiss him.  Suddenly the wall of the dungeon exploded with Mystic caster standing there in her warrior's uniform. 'She told you it was not her! She was telling the truth! 'She told him slamming him into the wall across the room.' You might have disabled her powers, but you did not disable me!' she said shooting fireballs at him. ' the reason I am being so hard on you, the fact that a warrior of the white light would never Kidnap and try to rape another warrior, especially the High Priestess when she turns you down for anything!' she said sending electrical shock waves through him.  He began screaming as the electricity out lined his body in a blue light, his body was shaking from electrical currents flowing through it.  Mystic caster filled with anger looked at the man with contempt. 'I Mystic caster, daughter of Mystic Shadow order this dishonorable warrior of the white light be sent to the one that eats evil souls!' she said as she through a white ball full of lightening at him causing him to blow up. She clothed her mother after unchaining her and taking her home.  When they arrived at the hospital she was met by everyone except for Murkcaster.  'Where is Murkcaster?' she asked looking around.  'He left early this morning with Coral shadow, we have not seen or heard from them since.' Rain caster told her' I tried locating them when Mystic caster had her vision of you're kidnapping when we were walking through the garden.'  Mystic Shadow wondered where he could be. She waited for hours trying to track him by spells, telepathic messages, but nothing. Finally at midnight he showed up. 'Where have you been?' she asked him. She had been worried about him, envisioning horrible things all night.  'We were tracking down an evil spirit.' He told her as he started getting ready to go to bed.  'Why didn't you answer my telepathic message?' she asked.  'I didn't get any.' He told her as he sat on the side of the bed.  'Why did you have everyone tuned out?' she asked him getting irritated.  'No why?' he asked.  'Did you catch the evil spirit?' she asked  'It got away.' He told her. 'Why?' he asked her wondering why all the questions.  'Well let's see, I was kidnapped, almost raped and it was our daughter who came to my rescue!' she told him as the anger flashed through her eyes.  'What?' he asked shocked that this all happened. He could tell she was pist off.  'I hope you had fun chasing your spirit while I was held hostage by Doom caster!' she sat turning her back to him.  'I will check in more often I promise.' He told her.  Mystic Shadow cried from despair of his almost lack of concern for her safety.  A month had gone by before Jada caster was released; Mystic Shadow went to get her. She cried in Mystic Shadow's arms when she realized the envy she had gotten could have cost Mystic Shadow her life.  'I am so sorry.' she told her crying.  'It's alright, you're cleansed and healed. Now let's go home.' She told her smiling holding her chin in the palm of her hand.  Returning back to the palace Murkcaster and Coral shadow were gone again. They finally returned hours later. Mystic Shadow was past worried this time, she was purely pist off and through with the whole thing. No man would ever make a fool of her again.  'Chasing spirits?' she asked sitting in their room.  'Yes.' He told her.  'No contacting me again?' she asked fuming.  'I tried, but then we just got caught up in chasing the spirit. I forgot.' He told her.  'Fuck you! Fuck your bullshit! You could have made contact if you had wanted to, but you did not! Just like you're promised!' she yelled at him.  'I swear I am telling the truth.' He said.  'No, here is the truth! Do what you want, when you want, with whomever you want! Because I will be!' she told him feeling the trust that he had earned back from her after the incident with the entity was gone. She would never be coming back to him. Two strikes your out as far as she was concerned.  The next morning she got out of bed with out waking him, dressed in her blue jeans that fit tight, she put on a white half top with spaghetti strings criss crossing in the front over her shoulders and back, she put on a pair of white sneakers. Walking out of the room she ran into Knight Shadow.  'Where are you going?' he asked her.  Mystic Shadow looked at him in the white suit and smiled at him as she changed him into blue jeans, a white shirt and sneakers. 'We're going to a carnival!' she said grabbing his hand as they vanished.  They appeared at the carnival something she always loved as a kid.  ' Remember I am Cheyenne and you're Roger.' She told him.  'I will try not to forget who we are.' He said smiling remembering the times they spent at the fairs.  She grabbed his hand as she pulled him to the round up; they had to stand up while it went around and around so fast, the gravity held them in the ride. She was laughing as her hair flew all around her face and into the air.  When they got off the ride they were laughing, then she saw a ride that looked like a huge boat swinging back and forth in the air. They were off on to that ride. She would sit with her arms up when they were in the up position and laughing as the swung back and forth. Next was the bumper cars, she was a speed demon hitting everyone who got in her way.  'Wiped you out on that one buddy.' She told him punching him in the arm lightly since he never hit her once with his car.  'You never were a good driver; you were always running down something.' He told her jokingly.  'Funny aren't we?' she said smiling. 'ooh I want a hot dog!' she told him running to the hot dog stand. They ate the hot dogs chasing it down with soda. 'There is nothing better then a hot dog from a carnival.' She said as she was chewing and talking with her mouth full like a little kid.  The next ride they went on was a cage, they sat in it and it began spinning them, going up & down side to side. When they got off she ran to the side of a building getting sick while he laughed at her.  'Want a nice greasy hamburger now?' he asked making her sick again.  'Oh please shut up will you?' she asked leaning on the wall. 'Let's see if we can still shoot,' she said dragging him to the game where she won him a small teddy bear smiling with the pride she felt.  'Let me try now.' He told her taking the riffle winning her the largest bear they had.  'Show off.' She told him sticking out her tongue.  They sat on a bench under a tree listening to the birds, acting like normal people instead of the witch and warlock they were. They stayed and closed out the carnival at midnight. Looking sad as the lights were going out, the rides were stopped and people were leaving.  'Ready to go back to who we really are?' she asked him.  'You haven't spoken of your husband all day, something wrong?' he asked her.  'No he seems to go chasing spirits all day and night with Coral caster. It has happened twice and never catching their spirit. So I guess we did the same thing and lost ours,' she told him just as they heard gunfire being shot at the people leaving; everyone began ducking down so they would not be shot.  'Oh my God a little girl was shot!' she said seeing her vision as she ended up next to the parents.  The little girl was crying Mystic Shadow laid her hands on her as Roger could no longer see the car. She removed the bullet with her magic then healed her. 'She is alright' she said handing her to her mother who was crying.  'An angel a real angel.' She said holding her four-year-old daughter with blond hair, and blue eyes. She looked just like her mother as Mystic Shadow and Knight Shadow vanished.  Unknown to Mystic Shadow and Knight Shadow the carload of five men killed ten people that night on their shooting rampage. The five men high on drugs and alcohol decided to make people their hunt, killing whoever got in the way of their bullets. They shot from the high-powered riffles they carried to do their deadly deed.  Murkcaster was angry when they returned to the palace seeing the teddy bears they each held.  'Have fun? Couldn't let me know where you were?' he asked through clinched teeth.  'We were chasing spirits and they got away.' She said sarcastically kissing Knight Shadow good night on his cheek.' Thank you for the great day.' She told him going into her room.  'Stay away from my wife.' Murkcaster told him.  Knight Shadow looked at him very coldly.  'Well I am willing to battle you for her if you want too?' he told him.  'Asshole! ' Murkcaster said then stormed into the room slamming the door Shut.  Knight Shadow laughed as he went to his room feeling on top of the world after spending the day with Mystic Shadow. He went to bed that night with a smile on his face.  Mystic Shadow pretended to be a sleep when he came to bed cussing under his breath about Knight Shadow.

507,507,2822042,0,47,"       Seduced By An Entity Ch. 22 by Erotica_Writings © The warriors were monitoring the ferocious windigo and its latest prey a young child named Sandy. They had to attack it at just the right time or they could cost the child its life.  Kaitlin a thirty year old woman who was stocky built, brown hair with blue eyes, she lived with her seventy six year old mother Molly who kept her hair dyed black. Molly was short and thin, with green eyes, in her younger days she was quite a gold digger. Dating men married or not, as long as they gave her the riches she desired. She felt not one ounce of guilt leaving Kaitlin, her older brother and sister home where they would have to eat mashed potatoes with ketchup for dinner while she dined in the finest of restaurants. Before Kaitlin had to move in with her mother Molly who had married her sixth husband Victor, he was twenty years her senior when she was sixty six years old thinking he was well off since he worked for the Swedish government. When she had used up his life savings taking lavish trips abroad, he became ill and bed ridden after their third year of marriage, she would attack him by pulling his hair while he lay in a fetal position screaming at him to die! His cruel wife tortured the old man for a year before she finally caused him to have a stroke by her constant attacks on him. This angered his wife Molly that he did not die from it. Kaitlin came to the house to visit him finding her mother and sister Wanda standing over him, Kaitlin knew by his mouth being drawn he had suffered a stroke.  'he has had a stroke aren't you going to take him to the hospital?' she asked looking at the man laying in his bed, even though Kaitlin and him did not see eye to eye on things she did not like seeing a human being suffering.  'No there is nothing they can do for him.' her mother replied drinking a glass of wine.  Kaitlin could not believe they were just going to let him lay there. She left feeling disgusted. As she could never get her mothers approval, she was always accusing her of stealing from her, telling her she wasn't any good and no one could ever live with her. She hounded Kaitlin causing her to turn to drugs and alcohol at twenty years old, but even after she had clean herself up from the drugs and alcohol, she became an executive in a law firm, her mother still accused her of doing drugs. When she stood up to her mother and did not bow down to her wishes. Kaitlin was always broke from the woman taking her money. Her mother had the rest of Kaitlin's family attacking her with false accusations and finally Kaitlin gave into her mother, just to shut her up. When Victor finally died escaping the hell he had to live with Molly, Kaitlin moved in with her mother because it was to much paying her own bills, much less her mothers. Her mother being the unappreciative bitch that she was made her life a living hell telling everyone how Wanda who looked just like Molly was the good one. Wanda never came around if she could avoid it, her brother Joe dropped out of sight twenty years ago because he hated his mother. She always tried to make Kaitlin to look like a looser, that Kaitlin was cruel to her, trying to push her around. Kaitlin would pray at night to be freed from this hell she had to live in. Kaitlin came home from work one day finding a woman who was of medium build, red hair, brown eyes holding a new born infant sitting in her house .' Kaitlin I met this poor soul at the dough nut shop, they had no where to go, I told her we would help her. She can't work because she needs to take care of the child and that I would support them,' her mother told her looking so sweetly at the woman.  Kaitlin turned to go to her room rolling her eyes.' You mean I will support them!' she said under her breath not wanting a confrontation with her mother again. In her room she would sit at her desk with her head in her hands questioning her sanity. A month had gone by with the new dependants thrust upon her. She sat in her bedroom listening to her mother screaming at the young mother Paula over her child Sandy, forcing Paula to give her the baby to hold when she knew she was trying to put her to bed. One night as Kaitlin sat in her bedroom she heard her mother yelling at the girl again.  'You are unappreciative, I support and feed you, gave you a roof over your head and you treat me like shit!' she yelled at the girl.  Kaitlin had enough with her berating this woman, not allowing her to do, as she should with her child. Kaitlin walked out of the room, the girl looked shocked for she saw Kaitlin was angry.  'This is not your child mother! And I am the one who feeds them, buy her diapers and all you did was to give them a place in your torture chamber of fucking hell!' she yelled in defense of the girl who was crying from her mothers abuse.  'I will slap you in your mouth you keep talking to me like that little girl.' She yelled as she turned charging at Kaitlin.  Kaitlin stood still with a look so intense on her face.' You don't want to lay a hand on me; I promise you will regret it.' Kaitlin told her in a calm voice.  'You're on drugs! I will find out who is giving it to you and someone is going to be in trouble!' she yelled at Kaitlin.  'Kiss my ass! That is always your answer to everything that I am doing drugs! 'She yelled back at her mother.  'Well look at how your acting!?' she screamed at Kaitlin. 'You get out of my house right now!' she yelled.  'Fuck you mother, I paid the bills here this week. Call the law and have them put me out you crazy old woman!' She yelled at her. Kaitlin turned around going back to her room knowing that the girl would not be yelled at anymore that her mother would make her an ally, bad mouthing her terrible daughter. 'Fuck you.' She said as she closed her door. 'I hate her, why can't you just die you old bitch so I can be free of you!' she said to herself sitting in her prison cell as she referred to her bedroom  After six months Kaitlin noticed just how nervous the girl was becoming.' Where is the wicked witch of the west?' she asked the girl.  'She went out.' She told her.' She fought with me all day, I was glad when she left.' Paula told her with a look of relief.  Kaitlin smiled.' I know the feeling.' She told her going into her room.  That night the baby had began to cry for five minutes when her mother was screaming at Paula that she was hurting the baby, probably sticking her with pins. Molly ripped the child from her arms. She had actually gotten the baby to only want her by spoiling her because in her sick mind she wanted the child to love her and not its mother. Kaitlin sat at her desk, her head in her hands with her eyes closed praying for her mother to just shut up. Later in the evening after Paula got the baby to bed Kaitlin heard her mother sneak into the room while Paula sat out side smoking a cigarette. She heard the baby screaming as if something scared or hurt it. Her mother barged into her room yelling at Kaitlin.' This baby has been crying for hours and you have not done anything for her, but to let her lay in that room crying!' her mothers face was evil looking as she held the baby.' I know sweet heart I am the only one who loves you.' She told the baby kissing its cheek as she patted her back.  'That baby was sleeping and has not been crying for hours. You went in there and did something to her.' She told her mother.  'I did not! You better stop lying on me and I mean it!' she screamed at her.' I am the only one with a heart in this house! None of you care for this little angel but me!' She said as Paula stood behind her.  ' Where were you at out screwing some man while your baby has been crying for hours!?' she yelled at Paula.  'You're really nuts! You're really fucking nuts!' Kaitlin yelled.' All the girl was doing was sitting outside smoking a cigarette.' She told her.  'You better shut up, if you know what is good for you! You will burn in hell for how you treat me!' she yelled.  'Shut up you self righteous hypocrite!' Kaitlin yelled back.  Her mother handed Paula the baby slapping Kaitlin across the face as hard as she could. Kaitlin stood up grabbing her mother by the arms, her teeth clenched.  'You ever lay your hands on me and I will break every fucking bone in your body!' she told her pushing her mother out of her room. Her mother started to run back in when Kaitlin turned looking at her with a look that scared her mother; she backed slowly out of the room.  Kaitlin went back to her room shutting the door.' I hate you!' she said to her self.  Paula knocked on the door 'Hey she left.' She told her through the door.  'Good maybe the boogie man will get her.' She told Paula as they both laughed.  As Molly walked through the dark alley she did not see the ten foot tall demon called a Windigo standing in the dark, its head was huge with large fangs, the mouth was twisted, and the eyes were beady. It attacked Molly viciously, biting into her flesh and ripping her apart.  Kaitlin looked at the clock it was eleven o'clock.' Pout you old bitch I am not coming to look for you.' she said going to bed.  Mystic Shadow and Mystic caster saw the attack in a vision as they saw the Windigo transformed into Molly and going back to the house knowing the baby was there. They preyed especially on children. Mystic Shadow and Mystic caster appeared in the room where the baby and her mother were sleeping.  'I feel evil had lived in this house.' Mystic Shadow whispered not wanting to awaken the child. She woke Paula up.' Don't be frighten we are here to save you.' She told her.  'Save me? Did Kaitlin send for you?' she asked her.  'Who's Kaitlin?' she asked.  'She's the daughter of the mean old woman Molly. So who sent you?' she asked.  'Quick go to Kaitlin with your child!' She told the girl feeling the demon was at the house.  She grabbed her child running out of the room where she saw Molly coming into the door of the living room.  Paula ran into Kaitlin's room slamming the door behind her scaring Kaitlin who was sound a sleep.' What's wrong?' she asked.  Before Paula could say anything Molly smashed through the closed door. 'Oh my God!' Paula yelled jumping on the bed with Kaitlin where both women and the child were screaming.  Kaitlin saw Mystic Shadow grab Molly and threw her into the wall with her powers.  'Do not look into her eyes!' Mystic caster yelled at the women knowing the demon could give one look that could scare them to death. Using her powers she smashed it into the wall of the living room not wanting to be bitten by it or it could transform again. The witches battled the beast with their powers when the other ten witches and warlocks appeared using all of their powers, they blew it up as Mystic Shadow sent it straight to the one who eats the evil souls.  Kaitlin and Paula stood looking at the people in their living room.' I knew she was an evil old woman, but I didn't think she was that mean that it took twelve of you to take her out.' She said looking surprised.  'That was not your mother; it was a Windigo, an evil demon.' Knight shadow told them.  'My mother was a demon in life as much as she tortured us.' Kaitlin told them. 'She won't come back will her?' She asked standing there with her arms crossed with a blank stare in her eyes.  'No, in fact she was sent to hell by Mystic of the Light.' Mystic caster told them then they all vanished.  Kaitlin had a smile on her face for the first time in a long time. That morning the women woke up to file a missing person report since they had no memory of the night before. To this day Molly has never been found.

Ouch he is cutting my throat and sucking my blood? Oh I don’t care he has me; I want more and more of him. His sucking of my blood feels so good; his hands caressing my breast and nipples are driving me as wild as him slowly moving his hard erection in and out of me slowly, teasingly.  Oh suck my neck more sweet man its driving me wild, I am so hot, so wet between my thigh’s, his lips have a red hint on them from the blood he sips from my neck. He seems to be relishing the sweet juices of my blood flowing in between his lips. My nipples are so hard and swollen like my clit, my body wants to feel the great waves of the orgasm building deep with in my very soul, oh I am going to explode as I feel his hard erection throbbing inside of me, slowly going deeper, yes so slow and harder, deeper, I can feel both of our throbbing organs and the mixture of heavy breathing.  Oh yes, yes, Mmmm Mmmm I am coming, yes! My nails dig into his flesh on his back as he sends me pass cloud nine. He moans from the release of his hot fluids deep inside of me. We lay without saying a word to each other we just lie in the silence and pure ecstasy of the hot blood pumping sex we just had shared. His hand is now on his shaft rubbing it to get it erect again.  He takes the ring he has been using to cut my neck with its sharp point and slowly slices his erection then takes my hand rubbing his ever so stiff erection with it and his blood oozes on to my hand and fingers, his breathing becomes intense, he is moaning in my ear. He cuts my breast and licks the blood off of it hungrily, he licks his blood from my hand and sits across my chest with his erection touching my lips, his blood is running across my chest and his balls are tucked securely under my chin and neck. I lick and suck at his erection quickly and eagerly to  Be filled with his hot thick juices into my mouth and down my throat. I don’t want this to end with him; I have never felt so sensual in my whole twenty years of experiencing sex. He has unleashed a dormant side of me.  He comes so hard, so deep in my mouth, his moans telling me just how much I satisfied him and yes I am proud of myself. He falls onto the bed on his back and pulls me on top of him. With his hand holding the back of my head and his fingers wrapped with in the strands his tongue probes my mouth and I suck his tongue wanting more, more give me more!  His hands are exploring my body, and one finger goes in my ass as his erection is back and he begins to explore the inside of my heat filled body. My breathing is heavy as he drinks the blood from my breast and I ride him in a slow circular motion, taking him deeper and deeper until we both scream out in a sweet delicious powerful orgasm. We are breathless and he is still so handsome, so sexual with the blood and sweat mixing together. We lay silently not saying a word just staring into each others eyes.  There is this annoying noise in my ear, I turn over in the bed and it’s my alarm clock, damn I was dreaming! It felt so real and I am even sticky between my thighs. Well it’s time to get up and go to work. The shower will feel so good on me this morning. Damn it! I took too long in the shower, now I am going to be late this morning and I am meeting with the new account!  Damn it! I’ve got to hurry and Get dressed; come on car start will you? Please start! Oh thank you. Oh no Tess saw me, shit! My office is right around the corner thank God I am only ten minutes late whew! Damn he looks familiar to me, where have I seen him before? I would love to suck him off until he came deep down my throat.  Where have I seen him before? Great! It will drive me nuts until I remember where I’ve seen him at…….. That’s where I have seen him …………in my dream….

524,524,2872565,1,25,"           The first thing I did today when I woke up was phone Poly and update them as to what was going on.  Surely they must have some suggestions to help me get out of this horrible situation...  There's gotta be a loophole I can escape through somehow, or a way that we can negotiate with that psycho Steven.    Unfortunately, they said there was nothing really that they could do.  It wasn't their place to get in the middle of this, and they weren't going to pay him off.  They suggested that I phone Steven back and try and do some bargaining - perhaps there was something else that I could exchange with him, or maybe I could talk him back to sanity.  So there I was, with having sole responsbility to deal with that mother fucking bastard who was screwing me over.  I was actually feeling pretty level-headed and calm today, but suddenly this wave of anger - productive anger - went through me and I felt the strength and confidence to take Steven head on.  If he wanted to play this stupid game, the only way I was going to win, or at least avoid getting deported, was to play along with him.    And really, who the hell did he think he was?  Does he not realize what he's messing with here?  This is the fucking S2H World Tour!!!  AND NOBODY FUCKS WITH THE S2H WORLD TOUR!!!  This is my project, this is my life, this is my dream that I've worked so hard to achieve, and had really only just begun.  I wasn't going to let one greedy mother fucking bastard change all that by trying to screw me over and send me home.  Uh-uh - I'm staying here in Korea, and that's all there is to it!  I knew that sacrifices would have to be made, and I was the only one who could give them up.  I had to make a deal with the devil, and so I did.  I phoned up Steven, and in my calmest, friendliest voice, offered him a deal in a polite and warm tone (while gritting my teeth and plotting his death silently...)  I offered that if he gave me my letter of release, then he would not have to pay me my wages for those last 3 weeks of work that he still owed me.  He said he'd think about it and get back to me...  Less than an hour later he phoned me back, and had agreed.  I'd get the letter from him, and in return he wouldn't have to pay me the 1.5 million Won he still owed me.  It was a huge price to pay (about $1500 CDN) but it was the only thing that I could offer him.  And in reality, I'd probably have never seen that money anyways.  He'd probably drag out the process of paying me that money long after I had started the new job, and in the end I'd most likely never seen a penny of it.  It was a bitter, jagged pill to swallow, but what other choice did I have?  He had me held over a barrel and he knew it - I had to offer him substantial enough bait for him to bite, and thank god he did.  Still, I was so angry, so bitter, so fuming with rage...why would he do this to me???  I phoned my parents to give them the update on what had happened in the last 24 hours, and they were as shocked as I was.  Not long after I got off the phone with them I went to make another phone call, only to discover that my phone had been cut off... WHAT THE FUCK, NOW???  Either Steven had decided to cut it off cause he's pissed or it's just a strange coincidence that it would suddenly, 'randomly' stop working today.  On top of that, my cell phone had been cut off too.  I now had no way of talking to anyone outside my house!!!  Thank God I still had the internet!!  The bastard may have cut off my main lifeline, but I wasn't dead in the water yet.  I decided that when Steven gave me the letter that evening, that was it, I was going to leave right away!!  I wasn't going to wait until tomorrow to move - I wanted to get out now.  Steven had originally offered to help me move, but had since decided that he was 'too busy' to help me anymore.  I didn't care about this, cause to be honest I didn't want the motherfucker knowing where my new home was going to be.  I wanted to run away, to escape from his clutches, to turn my back on that hellhole and never look back.  And I wanted to be safe knowing that he'd never be able to find me or cause me more frustrations.  I emailed my friend Michael and BEGGED him to come pick me up that evening when he got off of work and drive me and all my stuff to Ilsan.  I wasn't getting my keys to my new place until tomorrow, but I'd just crash at Steve's instead.  I totally felt like a refugee!!!  It was like I was living in a country when war broke out all of a sudden, and I couldn't escape cause they had closed the borders and my passport was in the hands of the evil totalitarian Nazi officer.  I wanted to flee to a safe country, to the refugee camp waiting for me on the other side, but had no way to get to it.  I had to get that 'passport' (the letter) and get the hell out any way I could.  I would flee in the middle of the night with all of my belongings and run away to a safe place.  I was the refugee, Shihung was the war-torn country, Steven was the Nazi, and Ilsan was my oasis salvation.    I spent all day packing up my belongings and downloading all my precious photos of friends and family that I had on the computer onto disk or my splashbulb site.  I couldn't leave anything behind cause once I left I knew I was never coming back.  And I wanted to remove all evidence that had I lived there.  Luckily I don't own a lot of stuff here so it didn't take long for me to get all my shit together.  At around 7pm Steven came home and I went up to exchange my deal with the devil.  I was terrified that he had changed his mind, or that he'd want more from me, or that he would find a way to try and milk more out of me.  Surprisingly, he was friendly, calm, and polite when I met up with him.  He had the letter already written out and handed it over, and then I had to sign a piece of paper agreeing that he didn't have to pay me the wages.  And that was it - clean and simple and easy - but I was trembling inside.  I kept expecting something else to go wrong, for that demon to rear his ugly head from inside Steven again.  But strangely enough, as soon as we did the deal, he was back to his normal, friendly self.  He had switched back to his old personality again, and was acting all chummy with me, as if he hadn't just fucked me over with his greed.  He was apologetic again for having to let me go in the first place, and wished me well at the new school.  He even offered to help me in the future if I ever needed it (like I'm ever going to contact you again, you motherfucker!!) and said that maybe he would help me move after all.  He even suggested that maybe sometime him and the fam can come over to see my new place and have dinner in Ilsan together?  I was completely confused and disturbed...who was the real Steven?  Whatever.  I've got my letter, I'm getting the fuck out of here!  I informed him that I was moving that night (he was surpised) and he seemed sad to see me go.  I went back downstairs and waited for Michael to come rescue me.  That was a whole other ordeal in itself...  I've never had anyone come visit me in Shihung before, so I had no idea how to give directions to get there.  There are no landmarks in my part of town, almost nothing is in English, and most of the streets don't even have names...    Michael and Gary eventually found me, but it took almost 2 hours of lost driving and wandering through both Shihung and Bucheon to find me.  I have never ever been happier to see a friend as when I finally saw Michael in his car!!  We packed up all my stuff and I gave back my key.  Steven and the whole family came out to wave goodbye to me and I thought that Steven was going to cry.  ????????????????  See ya, goodbye, adios, I'm outta here.  Thanks for fucking me over.  Have a nice day.  Buh-bye!  ;-)  Getting to Ilsan proved to be a challenge in itself as well!  None of us had ever driven from Shihung to Ilsan (totally across the city from each other) and we didn't know which streets or highways to take.  It took forever, and we ended up doing this criss-cross journey across Greater Seoul, including getting stuck on the Airport Express Freeway which brought us all the way to Incheon Int'l cause there's NO OFF-RAMPS, and involved doing some serious back-tracking...  Finally we got to Ilsan, and I was amazed that I was able to find the apartment building in the dark.    By the time we got there it was after midnight and I was completely exhausted.  But I had made it to the other side, reached safety, and knew that the worst was now behind me.  You hear all these horror stories about teachers getting screwed in Korea, and now I've lived through one of those experiences myself.  It's horrible.  I don't ever want to get screwed over like that again.  But now I just want to move on and forget about it.  I've got a new life to begin, and I'm not going to let one bad experience ruin my whole adventure here in Korea.  The S2H World Tour is bigger than all of that, and it's not gonna get bogged down by one (although significant) bump in the road!  I was sooooooo tired and was happy to go to bed at Steve's.  I gave the biggest thank you hugs to Michael and Gary and said goodbye.  I had escaped, I had survived - and I was *exhausted.*  This refugee collapsed into bed and fell into a deep, deep sleep, happy that the day was over.          ",4899,1000,The first thing I did today when I woke up was phone Poly and update them as to what was going on Surely they must have some suggestions to help me get out of this horrible situation There's gotta be a loophole I can escape through somehow or a way that we can negotiate with that psycho Steven Unfortunately they said there was nothing really that they could do It wasn't their place to get in the middle of this and they weren't going to pay him off They suggested that I phone Steven back and try and do some bargaining perhaps there was something else that I could exchange with him or maybe I could talk him back to sanity So there I was with having sole responsbility to deal with that mother fucking bastard who was screwing me over I was actually feeling pretty level-headed and calm today but suddenly this wave of anger productive anger went through me and I felt the strength and confidence to take Steven head on If he wanted to play this stupid game the only way I was going to win or at least avoid getting deported was to play along with him And really who the hell did he think he was Does he not realize what he's messing with here This is the fucking S2H World Tour AND NOBODY FUCKS WITH THE S2H WORLD TOUR This is my project this is my life this is my dream that I've worked so hard to achieve and had really only just begun I wasn't going to let one greedy mother fucking bastard change all that by trying to screw me over and send me home Uh-uh I'm staying here in Korea and that's all there is to it I knew that sacrifices would have to be made and I was the only one who could give them up I had to make a deal with the devil and so I did I phoned up Steven and in my calmest friendliest voice offered him a deal in a polite and warm tone while gritting my teeth and plotting his death silently I offered that if he gave me my letter of release then he would not have to pay me my wages for those last weeks of work that he still owed me He said he'd think about it and get back to me Less than an hour later he phoned me back and had agreed I'd get the letter from him and in return he wouldn't have to pay me the million Won he still owed me It was a huge price to pay about CDN but it was the only thing that I could offer him And in reality I'd probably have never seen that money anyways He'd probably drag out the process of paying me that money long after I had started the new job and in the end I'd most likely never seen a penny of it It was a bitter jagged pill to swallow but what other choice did I have He had me held over a barrel and he knew it I had to offer him substantial enough bait for him to bite and thank god he did Still I was so angry so bitter so fuming with rage...why would he do this to me I phoned my parents to give them the update on what had happened in the last hours and they were as shocked as I was Not long after I got off the phone with them I went to make another phone call only to discover that my phone had been cut off WHAT THE FUCK NOW Either Steven had decided to cut it off cause he's pissed or it's just a strange coincidence that it would suddenly randomly stop working today On top of that my cell phone had been cut off too I now had no way of talking to anyone outside my house Thank God I still had the internet The bastard may have cut off my main lifeline but I wasn't dead in the water yet I decided that when Steven gave me the letter that evening that was it I was going to leave right away I wasn't going to wait until tomorrow to move I wanted to get out now Steven had originally offered to help me move but had since decided that he was too busy to help me anymore I didn't care about this cause to be honest I didn't want the motherfucker knowing where my new home was going to be I wanted to run away to escape from his clutches to turn my back on that hellhole and never look back And I wanted to be safe knowing that he'd never be able to find me or cause me more frustrations I emailed my friend Michael and BEGGED him to come pick me up that evening when he got off of work and drive me and all my stuff to Ilsan I wasn't getting my keys to my new place until tomorrow but I'd just crash at Steve's instead I totally felt like a refugee It was like I was living in a country when war broke out all of a sudden and I couldn't escape cause they had closed the borders and my passport was in the hands of the evil totalitarian Nazi officer I wanted to flee to a safe country to the refugee camp waiting for me on the other side but had no way to get to it I had to get that passport the letter and get the hell out any way I could I would flee in the middle of the night with all of my belongings and run away to a safe place I was the refugee Shihung was the war-torn country Steven was the Nazi and Ilsan was my oasis salvation I spent all day packing up my belongings and downloading all my precious photos,94,test
532,532,2872565,1,25,"           Okay, so I'm starting, or let me say re-starting, this blog entry by saying how much I HATE COMPUTERS!!! My computer has a fucking virus in it and it's been causing some havoc and pissing me off big time.  I just finished typing out a nice detailed entry for this day only to have the computer fuck up and lose it all!!!!  I WAS SO MAD!!!!!!!  And trying to get rid of this virus is going to be a pain in the ass because my entire computer (and I do mean EVERYTHING) is in Korean so it's like trying to feel your way through the dark.  Even so I'm pretty useless when it comes to computers so even if this was in English I'd still have problems trying to fix it.  Argh!!!!!!!!!!!  Well on that happy note, let me return to RETYPE OUT AGAIN my weekend adventures.  This weekend was a really lazy one, but a really nice kind of lazy.  I met up with Brad, Andrea, Amy, and Pauline for lunch at the Subway in Itaewon, but because we all live so far out of the city by the time we all got down there it was 3pm!  Half the day gone already!  We then spent the afternoon just hanging out in Itaewon doing some window-shopping and eating ice cream - our current obsession.  I have to say that it's always *very* disorienting being in Itaewon because of all the foreigners there.  Everywhere you look there's Caucasians walking around and it always causes me to do a double-take, and think 'Where am I?  What country is this?'  I'm just not used to seeing so many white people together any more!  I can wander around Shihung for days and not ever see a foreigner.  Hell, the amount of times I've seen foreigners in Shihung during the whole time I've been here I can count on one hand!  90% of the foreigners in Itaewon are GI's (army guys) from the nearby base and believe me when I say that they sure make their presence known.  Most of us teachers (and most non-military foreigners in Korea) dislike the GI's - they're loud, rude, obnoxious, arrogant, are always causing a scene on the street, and I hate to say it, but they seem to embody and exemplify every single bad stereotype of Americans that you can think of.  Honestly, you can hear them coming down the street before you see them.  And this is when they're sober!  You should see what Itaewon is like at night during the weekends!  The whole area becomes this giant frat party filled with GI's who are running around absolutely shittered and causing a ruckus.  It's like when they're drunk they have the intellect and maturity of a 16 year-old who's gotten drunk for the very first time on his parent's stash of booze stolen from the cupboard.  I'm sure many of them are nice guys, but their behavior can often be just so obnoxious and so embarrassing that it's enough to make you THANK GOD that you're not American and associated with them.  So the weather has been absolutely beautiful lately!  I don't know what the temperatures have been, but this Saturday it felt like it was at least 20 C outside.  It was the perfect weather to be out and about in the sun and I love it.  It's funny to think that just 2 weekends ago when I was at the Cherry Blossom Festival I wore a touque in the afternoon because it was kind of chilly that day, and now you can get away with just wearing a t-shirt, shorts, and sandals!  What a massive and rapid change in weather!  I wish I could 'put a cap' on the rising temps because I know in just a month or so summer will be here, along with the supposed disgustingly hot and humid weather that Korea is known for.  Right now the weather is perfect though and I plan on enjoying it while it's still comfortable to be outside.  We decided to go on over to the Jonggak area so we hopped in a cab and made our way over to that part of Seoul.  When we got there the taxi driver let us out right in front of Chongo Tower - that crazy unusual futuristic Dr.Evil headquarters skyscraper that I've mentioned before.  Brad informed us that you can actually go up to the lobby of the restaurant at the very top and enjoy the view for free, so that's what we did!  The view was amazing but it was so freaky being up there!  The restaurant is literally suspended between 3 support beams that rise up a good 10 stories or so above the 'roof' of the building.  Criss-crossing the 'hole' of the circular restaurant are these mid-air walkways that allow you to look out and down to the city way below - SO SCARY!!!  It honestly feels as if the entire thing could collapse any second!  And ladies, if you ever go up to the top of Chongo Tower, be sure to make a pit stop in the washroom up there.  Apparently in the ladies room one whole wall of the washroom is glass, so that you can actually enjoy a magnificent view of the city WHILE YOU'RE SITTING ON THE CAN!  Wow!  How cool is that!?  We killed some time hanging out around there before Brad and Andrea went to go and see their movie.  They were going to see 'The Passion of the Christ' and I was invited to join them but I have no interest whatsoever in seeing that film.  It's not because of the religious content, I'd actually be quite curious to see it just for 'historical interests' but I've heard that it's very graphic and violent and I'm just too squeamish when it comes to stuff like that.  Watching nails being driven through Jesus' hands just doesn't sound like a fun way to spend 2 hours, if you ask me.  I, instead, headed over to the Starbucks to sit and read until they finished the film.  I was all prepared to be by myself for a few hours, but I wasn't alone for very long...  I had only been sitting there for maybe half an hour or so, when this this 20-something Korean girl came up and sat next to me.  I wasn't sure what she wanted at first so I just sat there and waited for her to do something.  She kept trying to catch my eye and then she finally broke the ice by asking me what I was reading.  Well anyways she was super nice and we spent the next hour and a half just chatting away!  It's not uncommon for Korean strangers to come up and speak to you cause they want to practice their  English, but this was the longest conversation I've had with a Korean stranger by far!  She wanted to hear all about life in Canada so I told her all about the beautiful wonders and splendour of Vancouver and she sat there wide-eyed, 'oohhing' and 'ahhing' at all my vivid descriptions.  We both had the same tastes in cheesy pop music, so since I had my discman with me, I suggested that we listen to some music.  She thought this was a great idea!  We totally got into and were rockin' out and singing along to my music, attracting many a strange looks from other patrons but having too much fun to care.    Brad, Andrea, Steve, and their friends Megan and Jess showed up later on and were quite surprised to see me boppin' away with some strange Korean girl!  haha!  It was time for dinner so I said goodbyes to my new friend Hyung-Kyung and we headed out.  The 6 of us went to a nearby Bennigan's and had a really yummy dinner.  I had never been to Bennigan's before (a US chain?) and was thrilled to be presented with a menu filled with dozens of choices - all food that I recognized!  This was only my second time eating at a proper sit-down Western restaurant since arriving and it was sooooo good!  After dinner we all took the bus back to Ilsan to play Scrabble at Brad's but by the time we got there everyone was so tired.  Megan and Jess went home and Brad, Andrea, Steve and I watched 'Jackie Brown', but we all fell asleep during the film.  Bedtime ensued shortly after that!  P.S. HAVE I MENTIONED HOW MUCH I FUCKING HATE COMPUTERS!!!!!!!!!!!  ;-)  (Sorry - I need to vent and I live alone so there's no one here to listen to me rant!  Just had to get it out one last time.)

535,535,2872565,1,25,"           Isn't it funny how life loves to throw you a massive, cruel curve-ball your way sometimes, just when everything is starting to go well?  You think you're in the clear, you think you've got both hands on the wheel of life and that you're in control, you think that it's nothing but smooth sailing in those waters ahead of you.  And then SHIT HITS THE FAN!  My, how quickly things can change from being so damn good to so completely, utterly, horribly bad.  I started off today thinking that I was on top of the world, that everything was falling into place, that I had nothing to worry about.  And then I had the rug pulled out from beneath me.  AND MAN DID I FALL HARD!  Here's how today went down...  Today's plan of action was to subway it from Ilsan to Shihung so that I could pick up my Letter of Release from my old boss Steven, and then subway it back again to Ilsan to deliver the letter to Poly.  This letter was absolutely crucial for me to get - my entire life in Korea depended on that letter.  The Letter of Release is what allows me to switch from one employer to another.  Basically, Steven has to write a letter that 'releases' me from his responsibility, and transfers that responsibility (via Immigration) to Poly who become my new sponsors.  Without it I can't get a new work visa with any school, and invariably have to go home to Canada as I can only remain unemployed in Korea for a very short period of time.  When I got into Shihung I phoned up Steven and asked if I could come down and pick up the letter.  His tone was less than friendly on the phone, and he said that he wanted to speak to my new director at Poly first.  I wasn't sure why, so I phoned Poly and told them to give Steven a call so that I could get my letter from him.  Well I waited and waited half the day for someone to phone me back and let me know what the hell was going on, but finally I had to phone Steven myself.  This is when Steven told me why he wasn't giving me the letter, and this is when my life completely fell apart around me...  Basically, Steven told me that unless Poly reimbursed him for my plane ticket to Korea, and paid him a fee of 500,000 Won, he would not give me the letter of release.  WHAT THE FUCK???  Why on Earth would POLY have to give Steven a bunch of money???  I don't get it!!!  Well according to Steven this was 'normal business practices' here in Korea, but it made absolutely no sense to me.  When I talked to Poly they said that this indeed was not a 'normal business practice' and that it was just Steven trying to get some money, using me as his bargaining chip.  And Poly wasn't going to cave in to his unrealistic, greedy demands.  Steven would not budge an inch at all, and no matter how much I begged and pleaded with him, he wasn't going to back down at all.  He wanted that money, and he wasn't going to give up my letter until he got it.  He knew that he was in a position of power, and he became so desperate and money-hungry that he was willing to fuck me over to get it.  Either Poly paid him, or Steven wouldn't give up the letter, meaning that I'd have to go back home to Canada.    Where the hell did all of this come from?  Where did this evil satanic side of Steven come from?  This is the same man who's family would make me dinner often, would take me on family trips to amusement parks, who wanted me to spend Christmas with his family at a ski resort, who was completely nice and caring to me since the day I arrived.  But he became blind with greed and seriously, it was like a whole other personality coming out.  I couldn't reason with him at all.  He kept insisting that this was 'not my problem' and that it was 'between the two directors', but he didn't seem to understand that I'M THE ONE WHO GETS FUCKED IF I DON'T GET THIS LETTER!!!  I'm the one who gets punished in the end, not the schools!!!!  Why the hell would he do this to me?  What did I ever do to deserve this from him???  It made absolutely no sense as to why Poly should pay him off.  They owed him nothing!!!  Steven brought me over to Korea with the promise that I'd be employed for a year.  He broke the promise, he let me go (with only 2 days notice, to boot), and now he wants my new school to pay HIM for HIS OWN MISTAKES???  It's not Poly's fault that Steven can't fucking run that school and is as broke as can be.  Why should the employer who's offering me salvation - a new job - from the conditions that HE PUT ME IN BY LETTING ME GO have to pay him off??  If anything, Steven should be thankful that I've found a job and that I'll be out of his apartment soon!!!  I just could not get my head wrapped around the whole thing.  After 45 minutes of getting nowhere on the phone, and both of us getting more and more angry and flustered and exasperated, I gave up for the night.  I got off the phone and practically had a nervous breakdown.  I phoned Ailish to vent all of this on her and almost started hyperventilating.  My entire future in Korea depended on that one stupid letter, and the one person who could give it to me had turned into a sadistic, greedy, money-hungry, low-life fucking piece of shit scumbag!!! What the hell was I going to do?  I didn't want to go back to Canada (I'm having too much fun in Korea, I like living and working here) and even if I flew to Vancouver and then back to Korea I still wouldn't be able to get a new VISA.  I had no hopes whatsoever for employment in Korea without that letter.  What was I to do?  I was completely and totally and utterly and royally F-U-C-K-E-D!!!  On top of all this, I had discovered something very unsettling in my apartment.  I had just sat down for dinner at my kitchen table when I looked over and noticed that there was something written on the table.  There, in blue pen, written right on top of the glass, someone had written:  You Kill  You Die Scott  WHAT THE FUCK WAS THIS!!!!!!!!?????????????????  Who the hell had written this?  And how the fuck did they get into my apartment?  AND WHY WOULD THEY WRITE THIS!!!???  Was this some sick joke, someone's idea of really bad humour, or was this a serious (death?) threat?  What did it mean????  Whoever had written this did it when I was staying at Steve's earlier in the week cause I had never seen it before.  The only person who has access to my apartment other than me is Steven.  Occasionally him or Susan will come into my apartment when I'm not home to clean it for me once in a while, but what the FUCK was this about???  To add to the confusion it wasn't even Steven's hand-writing...  It looked almost like a kid but not quite?  WHO WAS WRITING ME SICK MESSAGES ON MY FURNITURE WHEN I'M NOT HOME???    God, I really *REALLY* need to get out of this place...  I tried to clear my head and go through all the options but there didn't seem to be many.  How was I going to get out of this?  Steven wanted the money and wasn't going to back down, and Poly was refusing to pay him off.  It was a complete standstill, and I was caught in the middle.  I decided to try and get some sleep and talk to Poly again in the morning.  There has to be a way out of this hellhole...

536,536,2872565,1,25,"           I have a horrible habit that I've been trying to break for nearly 26 years now.&nbsp; It takes constant effort and continual reminders, but I have greatly improved at it.&nbsp; Still, I'm a long way from where I want to be.&nbsp; It'll probably take the rest of my life to get to that ideal point, and even then maybe not.&nbsp; The only comfort with this menace is that I&nbsp;know (or am just assuming/hoping) that I'm not alone in this condition.  &nbsp;  My horrible habit is that I tend to live my life in the future, and not in the present time.  &nbsp;  Let me explain...  &nbsp;  For as long as I can remember, I have been a 'planner.'&nbsp; No, I'm not talking in the urban/cityscape sense this time, I'm talking with just planning for where I want my life to go next.&nbsp; I've always been busy with looking ahead&nbsp;and am constantly thinking of where I want to be and how I can get there.&nbsp; Call it ambition, call it pro-activeness, call it avoiding the present, call it whatever you want.&nbsp; But either way I've always had my eyes on the future - what I'll be doing tomorrow, next week, next month, next year, and sometimes even 3-5 or more years down the road of life.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  This, in many ways, has been a great blessing.&nbsp; Ever since I can remember I've always known exactly what I've wanted to do in life, and pretty much every major goal I've ever set for myself I've been able to accomplish.&nbsp; I'm proud to say that right now at this very moment I am living the life I had always dreamed about.&nbsp; No wait, let me rephrase that...I am living a life that's *even better* than what I could have fathomed.&nbsp; I truly am a very lucky guy in that respect.  &nbsp;  On the other hand, this near obsessiveness with always calculating my next move in life comes with a heavy curse.&nbsp; I find it difficult, at times, to just 'enjoy the moment' and feel that I spend far too much time planning for 'what happens next.'&nbsp; Instead of just letting myself go by living completely in the present and enjoying all the fruits of my labour and just stopping to celebrate and just BREATHE, I refuse to let myself do so.&nbsp; It's like I've crafted the art of planning out my life to such a degree that I've lost all ability to live in the now.&nbsp; (Well maybe not *all* ability, my life *is* full of innumerable amazing moments that I truly do appreciate *at the time*, but not as many as I would like.)&nbsp; What is it about me that just won't allow myself to let go, to relax, to take a break from this chess game of life philosophy, from this self-imposed addiction, from this all-consuming hypnotic trance of living life&nbsp;dans&nbsp;la&nbsp;future?&nbsp; My feet may standly firmly and confidently and proudly in the present, but my head, way up in the clouds, lies in days yet to come.  &nbsp;  It really bothers me, at times.&nbsp; Again, I have to re-emphasize, it's not that I'm unhappy with the present, it's just that I can't seem to NOT be constantly looking ahead to what is yet to come, planning and preparing and getting ready for whatever goal or project or phase I've set for myself next.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, all the while in high school all I could think about was what life would be like when I got to BC and was in university.&nbsp; My&nbsp; high school days were awesome, really fun, care-free, adventurous, healthy and happy, yet all I could think about was SFU.&nbsp; And then when I was in university, all I could think about was what kind of career/travelling I would be doing once I graduated.&nbsp; My university days were the best days of my life, I loved my school, had more friends than I knew what to do with, and was living in the&nbsp;most beautiful city in all the world.&nbsp; And yet then I was still always looking ahead.  &nbsp;  And now here I am, in 2004 and nearly 26 years old, having the ultimate adventure of a lifetime in Korea, but yet it's a constant battle to not keep thinking 24/7 about my backpacking odyssey across Asia I'm planning once I finish teaching here, as well as my teaching adventures in Prague that I've got planned.&nbsp; Ahhh, my curse keeps on going!&nbsp; As long as I'm still alive will this always be how I am?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  And talk about presumptious!&nbsp; How do I know I'm even going to get that far?&nbsp; I could die tomorrow from an aneurism or&nbsp;from being run over&nbsp;by a car or from severe food poisoning by extremely bad kimchi!&nbsp; Who's to say how long my life will be?&nbsp; How egotistical and over-confident of me to feel so sure that I'll still be here tomorrow.&nbsp; A long time ago I remember seeing a quotation on the bedroom door on my good friend Benoit.&nbsp; I don't remember exactly how it went (and it was also in French) but it roughly said something like 'You are so confident and so sure of your life, you who cannot count on a single day.'&nbsp; It really struck a chord with me then and it's another incentive and reminder now of why I need to work on living in the present.  &nbsp;  Because it's so true!&nbsp; *Now* really is *all* that we have.&nbsp; The past doesn't actually exist anymore - it's just a collective memory in our complex, fragile&nbsp;brains.&nbsp; And the future doesn't have any physical tangibility to it at all - it's merely just a hopeful concept.&nbsp; This exact moment is all that I'll ever have and I really should do more to be thankful for it and to soak up every single microsecond of its infinite wonderfulness.  &nbsp;  Is this complex of mine one that was genetically pre-determined, as in it's just 'who I am' and that I never really had a chance to fight it, or is there more to it?&nbsp; Is it culturally and socially-instilled in me from birth?&nbsp; Have I been programmed to live my life in tomorrow instead of today?&nbsp; I did a paper once in university about the different ways that cultures 'deal with' time and it was quite fascinating.&nbsp; I can't get into all the details now, but basically the conclusion was that cultures that don't take time so seriously (prime example - Latin cultures) live, on average, much happier and much more stress-free lives than cultures that obsess and agonize over the clock (prime example - Canadian/American culture.)&nbsp; Every time I think about this issue I keep going back to the lessons learned in that paper.&nbsp; It really does seem like our culture brain-washes us to live such lives.&nbsp; Why do we do this to ourselves?&nbsp; Is it really that important to be such obsessive organizers and planners, to have every minute of the day mapped out in our own little agendas?&nbsp; To need to have everything happen exactly on time or heaven falls apart?&nbsp; To be prisoners of our own clocks and alarms and schedules and wrist-watches?&nbsp; Our timeliness and efficiency and organization may be spectacular, but at what cost to the rest of our&nbsp;lives?  &nbsp;  But I'm not here to point fingers or to make up silly excuses.&nbsp; I'm just trying to figure myself out.&nbsp; Which, at times, can be the hardest thing in the world to do.&nbsp; At least I've identified one of my own greatest personal challenges (that's half the struggle!) and am prepared and willing to take it on.&nbsp; I don't exactly know what to do about it - it's like trying to rewire my brain, but I really do want to improve.&nbsp; My life is too damn amazing to just ignore it as it flows right on by!&nbsp; And who really knows when it'll be gone?&nbsp; I'm blessed enough to have 26 years of wonderful and amazing memories.&nbsp; It's time I switch from just relishing my precious memories and worshipping my (not-so) secret ambitions and start soaking up the today.&nbsp; 'Life is now', and that's gotta be my new everyday philosophy.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;            ",5468,1000,I have a horrible habit that I've been trying to break for nearly years now.&nbsp It takes constant effort and continual reminders but I have greatly improved at it.&nbsp Still I'm a long way from where I want to be.&nbsp It'll probably take the rest of my life to get to that ideal point and even then maybe not.&nbsp The only comfort with this menace is that I&nbsp;know or am just assuming/hoping that I'm not alone in this condition nbsp My horrible habit is that I tend to live my life in the future and not in the present time nbsp Let me explain nbsp For as long as I can remember I have been a planner.'&nbsp No I'm not talking in the urban/cityscape sense this time I'm talking with just planning for where I want my life to go next.&nbsp I've always been busy with looking ahead&nbsp;and am constantly thinking of where I want to be and how I can get there.&nbsp Call it ambition call it pro-activeness call it avoiding the present call it whatever you want.&nbsp But either way I've always had my eyes on the future what I'll be doing tomorrow next week next month next year and sometimes even or more years down the road of life.&nbsp nbsp This in many ways has been a great blessing.&nbsp Ever since I can remember I've always known exactly what I've wanted to do in life and pretty much every major goal I've ever set for myself I've been able to accomplish.&nbsp I'm proud to say that right now at this very moment I am living the life I had always dreamed about.&nbsp No wait let me rephrase that...I am living a life that's even better than what I could have fathomed.&nbsp I truly am a very lucky guy in that respect nbsp On the other hand this near obsessiveness with always calculating my next move in life comes with a heavy curse.&nbsp I find it difficult at times to just enjoy the moment and feel that I spend far too much time planning for what happens next.'&nbsp Instead of just letting myself go by living completely in the present and enjoying all the fruits of my labour and just stopping to celebrate and just BREATHE I refuse to let myself do so.&nbsp It's like I've crafted the art of planning out my life to such a degree that I've lost all ability to live in the now.&nbsp Well maybe not all ability my life is full of innumerable amazing moments that I truly do appreciate at the time but not as many as I would like.)&nbsp What is it about me that just won't allow myself to let go to relax to take a break from this chess game of life philosophy from this self-imposed addiction from this all-consuming hypnotic trance of living life&nbsp;dans&nbsp;la&nbsp;future?&nbsp My feet may standly firmly and

539,539,2872565,1,25,"           Today was an awesome day!  It was my first time visiting central Seoul, and actually was a day full of 'firsts.'  I had made plans with my new friend Michael to hang out in the city, but in order to meet up with him, I had to take my first subway ride.  I rode the 015 bus to Bucheon Station (where I had partied the other night) and before catching the bus attempted to make a phone call to Michael to let him know I was getting on the train...  It proved to be much more difficult than I had thought it would be!  I've never made a local phone call before, and was under the impression that all one had to do was drop in a 100 coin and dial....  Well I tried this, but instead had some pre-recorded Korean man sing me a song, three times, then a long pause, then some other pre-recorded message by an operator lady, and then a horrible screeching sound!  What the fuck?  I thought maybe it didn't work because I was so far out in the burbs, and decided to try again later once I got in the city.  I had to take two trains to get to where Michael lives, and it turned out to be really easy!  Seoul's subway system is not only colour-coded, but also has all its signs in English as well as Korean, so navigating it is a breeze.  Riding a giant underground subway has as a very 'metropolitan feel' to it...much different than riding Vancouver's SkyTrain, which feels more like a Disney ride to me.  Michael lives on the other side of Seoul from me, so it took almost a full hour on the train just to get to his part of town!!  When I got off the train I attempted to phone him again, and had the same problems!!!  What was I doing wrong?  Eventually I had to ask some Korean guy, using only gestures, to show me how to work the damn phone.  And what did he do?  Just dropped in the coin and dialed...and it actually worked!!!  I really don't know what I was doing earlier that messed things up so much...haha!  Michael met me a few minutes later outside the station, and we decided to head on down to Itaewon, which is the foreigners' neighbourhood in Seoul.  Because it was a rather rainy and cold day, he offered to drive - so nice of him!  Michael is a super cool guy - he's 25 and from Minneapolis, and has been in Korea almost a year and a half travelling and teaching English.  He's totally a pro at life in Seoul, and was the best tour guide a guy could ask for.  He not only knew his way around this crazy city, but was full of interesting facts about the different neighbourhoods that we passed through.  We arrived in Itaewon and it was totally weird being there!  It's an equal mix of Korean and English signs, and the streets were crawling with foreigners!!!  Between the mix of Asian and Western people and signs, and the dreary weather, it was just like being back in Vancouver!  Well, not exactly - but awfully close!  We walked around and he showed me tons of cool stuff - where the cool clubs are, what restaurants are good, and also a few stores that sell Western products that you just can't find anywhere else in Seoul!  SO IMFORMATIVE!!  :-)  We had lunch at this restaurant popular with foreigners called Geckos.  Its menu was full of Western food, and the place was packed with American military!  (Yongsan Base, which is a huge American military base, is just nearby.)  We ordered lunch and chatted away, and then realized that we have mutual friends!!!  I was shocked to find out that Michael used to date someone that my ol' Thunder Bay buddy Craig used to date (back when he lived in Minneapolis), and has even been to Craig's house!!!  WOW!!!  What a small world I tell ya!  That whole six degrees of separation thing is so true!!!   Amazing!  :-)  After Itaewon Michael took me to Namdaemun Market - one of Seoul's largest and most popular outdoor markets.  Turns out that this particular Sunday was sort of an 'off day' at the market, as things were much quieter than usual there.  Still, it was great to wander through the many streets and alleys, checking out all the stawls selling anything and everything imaginable.  The market is so big that it was take a whole day to really explore it fully, but it was cool just to have a sample!    After Namdaemun Market, Michael drove us over to COEX Mall - one of, if not the, largest shopping complex in Korea.  The drive there was awesome as it took us right through the heart of Seoul and past many landmarks - museums, memorials, parks, soaring skyscrapers, and busy diverse neighbourhoods.  Seoul is an incredible city - there's so much to explore that it just blows my mind away.  We also went past Seoul Tower which is in Namsan Park - a big mountain right in the middle of the city!  And then across the Han River - the wide, slow-moving river that bisects Seoul.  Highrises filled the horizon no matter where you looked, and crazy-huge super-freeways lined the banks of the river.  Wow!  COEX Mall is massive and extremely busy, and besides containing hundreds of stores, also has 3 food courts, two luxury hotels, a huge conference centre, an aquarium, a nightclub, and a giant movie theatre called MegaBox that holds 17 screens.  And did I mention that it was BUSY!!!???  :-)  We spent a good hour plus just wandering around checking out different stores and the various food courts.  It was a bit overwhelming to be in there, but I guess I better start getting used to all the crowds here in Seoul!!  After that it was some dinner at the food court (chicken curry for me, which also included kimchee, 2 kinds pickled radishes, a bowl of seaweed, and a small serving of tiny baby silver fish!)  Quite the combo!  And all for only 5000 won! (about $6 CDN.)  After dinner it was time for me to head back to the burbs.  I said my goodbyes to Michael, who seems really sincere and genuine, and also has a lot of common interests as me.  I think that we will become really good friends and I look forward to hanging out with him again sometime soon.  The subway home was long but relaxing, except for the part where this disabled guy entered our car...  I have no idea where he came from, but this guy was probably about middle age or so, and didn't have any use of his legs, so he just shuffled along the floor, dragging himself to move from one end to the next.  His legs kept twitching and he smelled absolutely terrible.  He was going from subway car to subway car (including dragging himself inbetween cars while the train was in motion!) to beg for money from other passengers.  It was the saddest sight I've seen yet here in Korea.  He looked so sad and pathetic and near helpless, as he was struggling to move along.  I'm assuming this is what he does all day to make ends meet?  I really don't know...  I was really impressed with the number of passengers, young and old, who gave him money.  I think if I had seen this guy back home the vast majority of people would have just walked over him, or tried to pretend like he wasn't there, but the Koreans around me seemed to be really generous towards the poor man.  A sobering experience nonetheless, and a good reminder of how blessed I am (not only am I lucky enough to be able to experience life in a foreign country, but I have full use of my legs!  Both things that I should never take for granted...)

546,546,2872565,1,25,"           So the ball for me finding a new job is well in motion!  I called a recruiter reccommended to me by my friend Gavin this morning and she was great!  She was super friendly and knows of some upcoming jobs in Seoul that will be hiring very soon.  She's also going to put my application in for 100 VERY LUCRATIVE teaching positions at elementary schools, beginning in July.  Yes, that would mean teaching at a REAL SCHOOL!  They're the kind of jobs that a foreigner would sell his own mother for so it'll be very competitive to get one of those positions.  Here's hoping I do!  (And don't worry Mom, I've no plans to put you up on e-bay anytime soon!)  hehe!  All of the positions she mentioned sound attractive - I'm going to be a bit more fussy this time around in selecting a school and location.  I'm a 'seasoned veteran' now and know how the system works so I feel pretty confident I'll get a good job soon.  And I can afford to wait a little while for a good one to come up.  I'm definitely willing to be patient.  I told my kids at school today that I would be leaving very soon.  At first they didn't seem to understand that I was going to be leaving *and not coming back* but then they finally got it.  They all seemed very sad (my older kids did anyways) and a couple of them even wrote me little goodbye letters in class today.  THEY ARE SO SWEET!!!  Here are the letters that I received today, written exactly as they are in the note:  To Scott  Hello? Scott  My name is Cherry Scott.  biy-bay Good boy Scott  Verry hansom Scott ~ I am crying  - Cherry -  To: Scott Scott! Hi.  My  name is James. Scott is school English Teacher Bye-Bye :-( GoodBye Scott is Good boy very good Boy Scotty bye-by Scott Teacher my very very sad :-( - James -  To: Scott Scott, Hello? My name is Debbie. Scott, Monday bye bye! I'm verry verry sad! :-( Scott, bye bye Scott, (below in giant letters) I *heart* you - Debbie -  How cute are my kids!!  Doesn't that just make your heart melt???  I'm really gonna miss them...  After work today I sent off my resume to two other recruiters that friends reccommended to me so we'll see what they come up with.  I've now got THREE recruiters working for me so I'm pretty sure that by the end of next week I'll either have an interview or a solid lead on a specific job.  Things often work really fast around here so I don't think I'll be sitting around my apartment for ages and ages.    In the meantime, I've decided that a little holiday is in order.  This weekend I am going camping at Bukhansan National Park with Brad, Andrea and Steve.  We actually have had this planned for quite a few weeks as it is the last weekend that the four of us get to spend together as both Brad and Andrea leave next Thursday.  I'M GOING TO BE SO SAD TO SEE THEM GO!!!  The four of us have been inseparable since March and I can't imagine my life here in Korea without them.  We all connect SO WELL, much more so than I have with my other friends, and it's going to be impossible to replace them.  But, such is the life of an expat.  People are constantly coming and going so as someone who's planning on spending the next couple of years teaching and travelling overseas I better get used to goodbyes.    As for my holiday, well next week Andrea and I are going to go to Jeju Island for a few days!!!  She really wanted to go and check out Jeju before she left but didn't have anyone to go with.  Well suddenly I have a lot of free time on my hands, and I've been wanting to go to Jeju so I thought why not???  We're gonna leave on Monday and come back on Wednesday so it's just a short visit but it's going to be great.  It's supposed to be stunningly beautiful there (it's a subtropical volcanic island about 85 km. off the south coast of Korea - you have to fly there) and it'll be great for 'bonding time' between me and Andrea before she leaves me to go back home.  So basically starting this weekend I'm travelling for the next 5 days - WOO HOO!!!  *(expect the blog to be quiet for a while!)*  Mark phoned me up tonight to see if I wanted to join him for dinner so I said 'sure!'  (Mark's the American guy who lives near me who I just met the other day.)  We ended up having quite the long night tonight!!!  We went to this restaurant/bar just behind Kolon-Mart for some dinner and a couple beers.  Well we were sitting outside on their patio when these two middle-aged Korean guys came up and joined us at our table.  They wanted to meet us and practice their English, and they both seemed friendly enough so Mark and I were cool with it.  They ended up staying quite a while and we all kept ordering more and more beers, trading language lessons and just talking about life in Korea and stuff.  Well they were so nice that in the end not only did they pay for the whole bill (including our dinners!) but they also invited us to their respective homes for dinner in the future.  KOREANS ARE SO FRIENDLY AND HOSPITABLE!!!  :-)  They left us around 10pm or so and Mark and I thought this was going to be the end of it.  Well they came back about 5 minutes later and insisted that we follow them down the street.  Just half a block down was some bar that had just opened and was having a freebie OPEN HOUSE so they wanted us to join them at this new bar.  We ended up having more beers and some platefuls of snacks, ranging from dried cuttle fish to watermelon to banana chips to almonds to squid tentacles.  We all stayed there for a good hour plus and had a great time just chatting it up.  After we left there and said our goodbyes, Mark wanted to pop in at *another* bar just up the street to visit a friend of his (ie: a girl he's trying to pick up...hehe!)  So it was another drink at another bar and more cool Koreans to chat with.  This night just kept going and going but it was all great fun.  Mark and I are becoming good buddies already, and I'm getting to meet lots of cool people in the area in the process.  Too bad I'm going to be leaving Shihung so soon! (words I never thought I'd say!)    I got home just after 1am feeling a little tipsy (but having spent nothing as the Korean guys and then Mark paid for everything!)  Tonight was sorta like my pre-weekend celebration/kick-off to what I know is gonna be a really really awesome 5-day stretch.  Be prepared for lots of great stories when I get back (and some breathtaking photos, as well, I'm sure!)

island about km off the south coast of Korea you have to fly there and it'll be great for bonding time between me and Andrea before she leaves me to go back home So basically starting this weekend I'm travelling for the next days WOO HOO expect the blog to be quiet for a while Mark phoned me up tonight to see if I wanted to join him for dinner so I said sure Mark's the American guy who lives near me who I just met the other day We ended up having quite the long night tonight We went to this restaurant/bar just behind Kolon-Mart for some dinner and a couple beers Well we were sitting outside on their patio when these two middle-aged Korean guys came up and joined us at our table They wanted to meet us and practice their English and they both seemed friendly enough so Mark and I were cool with it They ended up staying quite a while and we all kept ordering more and more beers trading language lessons and just talking about life in Korea and stuff Well they were so nice that in the end not only did they pay for the whole bill including our dinners but they also invited us to their respective homes for dinner in the future KOREANS ARE SO FRIENDLY AND HOSPITABLE They left us around pm or so and Mark and I thought this was going to be the end of it Well they came back about minutes later and insisted that we follow them down the street Just half a block down was some bar that had just opened and was having a freebie OPEN HOUSE so they wanted us to join them at this new bar We ended up having more beers and some platefuls of snacks,72,test
547,547,2872565,1,25,"           Oh us humans are a silly species...  We drink ourselves silly for no logical reason whatsover, wake up the following morning feeling like we've been runover by a bulldozer - 12 times over - and swear that we'll never drink again, only to 'forget' about our promise to ourselves, and repeat the whole damn thing over a few weeks later (or a few days in some people's cases!) ... how we've lasted this long on this planet without killing ourselves off via hangovers is a miracle in itself!    I woke up today at Gavin's with a bitch of a headache and feeling sore ALL OVER (a combination of yesterday's aggressive yoga, many hours of dancing, and sleeping on a paper thin mat on a hard bedroom floor...ugh!)  I got to meet Gavin's really cool roomie though, Ryan, and he nursed me back to health with chamomile tea....yum!  :-)  We all just hung out and chatted for a while, and then I headed back to Shihung.  I was doing completely fine on the trains and all and was almost home when all of a sudden it just got *really* crowded and REALLY HOT on the train and I knew I was gonna pass out if I didn't either sit down or get off the train *immediately*.  Being that the train was packed, my only option was to get off at an earlier stop, get some fresh air, and peel off some layers.  It was so warm today!  Has spring finally sprung?  (or is this sweatiness just a result of my stupid self-inflicted dehyration?)  Whatever...I was glad to get home and relax.  Actually, I didn't even relax.  For some strange reason whenever I'm hung over I seem to *really enjoy* doing housework.  I have no idea why, it makes absolutely no sense at all, but I always do the most cleaning in my apartment the morning after I've had a few too many drinks.  So I did laundry and washed all my dishes and cleaned my kitchen - what a productive boy I was!  ;-)  So, onto a new topic...  I see a lot of reminders about September 11th all the time here, or mostly, just images of the Twin Towers, which automatically makes me think 'Oh my god!  September 11th!  They're gone!!!'  In fact, I see the World Trade Centre every single Monday to Friday.  At the top of the stairs, when I'm walking into work, is a poster for REI.  Well my school and the staircase leading there is full of REI posters, but this one stands out.  Being that the name of my school is REI:  American  Language School it's no surprise that my school is full of American imagery - the stars and stripes, The Statue of Liberty, and lots of posters of happy-faced white kids embraced with equally-happy-faced Korean kids.  However, at the top of this stairs is this one poster that you just can't miss - a young Korean boy and girl standing next to a Caucasian male and female teacher and a Korean male 'director(?)'...and rising up behind them is the skyline of Lower Manhattan....Twin Towers front and centre of the poster.  It catches my eye every single day and is a constant reminder of something that is no longer there.  Whether this is just an outdated poster or what, I'm not sure, cause obviously the Koreans are aware of the Towers' demise.  The REI poster is excusable, but I often see another reminder of the Twin Towers that I find puzzling and inexplicable.  At one of the subway stations I use frequently to transfer lines, there is a large, bright poster for one of Korea's major banks.  The bulk of this poster is the face of the Statue of Liberty, staring out over the harbour, but in behind her, in fully clear and obvious view, again, is the WTC rising high out above the forest of New York skyscrapers.  Now this is a modern, contemporary, RECENT poster released by the bank.  It's not outdated (ie: printed before September 11, 2001) so I'm definitely confused as to why the graphic designers/big bank marketing team decided to place such a controversial image in their ad campaign.    Now don't get me wrong - I'm not 'bothered' or 'disturbed' or 'upset' by it.  I'm not one of those ridiculously over-sensitive people who thinks that we should outlaw and erase every single image of the Twin Towers that exists so that we don't 'offend' Americans or whoever might freak out by seeing a photo of the late New York icons.  I'm just puzzled as to why the Koreans continue to place these well-recognized towers in contemporary media.  They're obviously aware that they're gone - do they just not care or maybe they want to 'always remember' or maybe they're just using them because they  are  a well-recognized American icon that they (whatever particular company is using them in their ad) want to associate their product with American ideologies?  (I'm assuming that these 'ideologies' would be freedom, power, and an obsession with consumption?)  It's an excellent example, anyways, of proof that the events surrounding September 11th affected different nations in varying ways.  I'm coming from North America where that day made our world completely stop and has affected mass culture so much.  Obviously it had a much lesser effect on Korean popular culture.  I mean, you would NEVER see CIBC or Bank of America come out with a poster like that - Oh My God could you imagine the screams of complaints that would flow in???  Later that night before going to bed I was just channel -urfing and came across Die Hard 2.  I remember watching this movie over and over years ago and absolutely loving it.  It was like one of my faves for such a long time, no surprise given the fact that I've always had a penchant for action movies containing scenes of mass destruction and plane disasters.  Anyways watching it again tonight I realized how....lame and cheesy (like in a bad way - the lines in this movie really are terrible) and OUTDATED this movie is!!!  It's set circa 1993 and in the movie they're talking about the 'amazing wonders' of 'incredibly advanced technology' such as cell phones (the size of large blocks of cheddar) and fax machines and computers that look to weigh about 67 pounds each!  Anyways this movie reminded me again of September 11th, cause in the movie Dulles Int'l Airport is  completely taken over  about as easily as it would be for me to overtake a 6-year old's lemonade stand!  SO MANY things happen in that movie that made me shout out to the TV 'That would SO NEVER be able to happen now!!!' given the current state of obsessive security, tight restrictions, and military-like grip the government has over America's major airports and airlines.  Yes, Die Hard 2 is just a cheesy meaningless action flick that was completely unrealistic, even for 1993, but even then it just goes to show how much things have changed in just ten short years in our world...

557,557,2872565,1,25,"           So with all the upcoming changes at REI I've been busy in my free moments sorting out in my head what options may lay ahead, how I may approach both the good and the bad that will come about with the new education plan, and what to do if the worst-case scenarios do come about.  Basically one of two things could happen with this new education plan.  It either ends up saving the school and I don't lose my job (but I may have to work shitty hours or have really long days) or it fails, and the school ends up closing and I lose my job.  I've been thinking a lot about what would happen if the school closed and I lost my job, or if things became so bad at work that I had to quit.  I really don't want to quit, but if I feel the new plan screws me over I'm prepared to walk away from this job.  I don't want to do that, and will consider that a last-resort option, but it *is* a possibility.  I can only be patient and reasonable to a degree, and after that I'm just not willing to budge.  I'd feel guilty for walking away and leaving Steven high and dry, but hey it's not really my fault.  We agreed to certain conditions in the contract, and so technically he's breaking the contract FIRST by bringing about all these changes.  Again, as mentioned before, I know he's only trying to do what's best for the school and is not intentionally trying to screw me over, but there just might not be a future for me here at REI.  This potential has meant that I have to come up with a good solid Plan B in case this proves true.  If I had to quit, or lost my job, there's a few options out there.  The most obvious one is to just get a new teaching job here in Korea.  That should not prove to be difficult at all, as there's SO MANY jobs here that I could find something easily.  And plus I'm already in Korea, so that would save a future employer from having to pay to fly me over.  And I also have experience now (as brief as it is) which would look attractive on a resume.  However...there's a major catch to getting a new job in Korea.  Actually there's several...  Firstly, I'd lose my current work visa and would have to get a new one.  This is not a huge deal in terms of paperwork, but the thing is, you can only get a work visa from OUTSIDE of Korea.  I'd have to do what many other teachers have done before when they switch employers, which is to fly to Japan for the day and get a new work visa.  This is actually more regular and routine than one would imagine, but it's still something I'd like to avoid.  Some employers will pay for your day trip to Japan and others will not.  That could be a major cost to me, one I really can't afford.    Secondly, pretty much every single employer in Korea only wants to hire teachers for a minimum of a one-year contract.  Anything less is, from what I've gathered, almost unheard of here.  This would mean that I'd be starting back at Day 1 again.  It's not that I don't like Korea (I really am having a blast here and love the country) but I came here with the idea that I'd only be here for one year.  I've already formulated plans for what I want to do after next February when my current contract is up.  I was hoping to spend a few months backpacking in Asia, and then return home to Canada for a brief visit before, ideally, moving to Europe to teach English there.  Any extension of my time in Korea affects all my plans after.  And I really don't want that!  There's two things that I could do to get around this time restriction.  One, is to sign on for a one-year contract, and then just leave mid-contract, like 8 or 9 months into it.  Many teachers have done this before so I wouldn't be the first one, but I hate the idea of being dishonest or screwing over an employer.  And plus, if you leave your contract early you don't get the plane ticket home (not a big deal, as since I'm going travelling in Asia I'm effectively throwing it away anyways) and you don't get the bonus (equivalent to one month's pay - a huge incentive to finish your contract.)  It is the loss of that bonus that makes me reconsider doing this...  Or, I could look at teaching in another country until February or March of next year.  Some other countries are much more flexible with your contract length (China being a prime example) and so this is an option I'm seriously considering if I have to quit/the school closes.  I don't know if Taiwan, Japan, or Thailand have less than one-year contracts but I'm going to try and find out as I would certainly consider moving to one of those countries to teach for a few months.  The only downside to this is that most other countries don't pay as well as Korean schools do, so switching to another school in another country would probably (but not definitely) mean less income generated in the long run (even if you consider the loss of a bonus here in Korea.)  It's all so very complicated!  I haven't hit the automatic eject button yet, and am trying to remain positive and level-headed, but am prepared to do just that if need be.  Really, I just want to make sure that I have options if indeed the shit does hit the fan.  No matter what it won't be an easy or simple decision, so I really have to be careful with what I choose in the end.  But I mean hey maybe these new changes will actually make things *better* at work and I may end up liking them.  And then all of this uncertainty and stress will just be a distant memory.  I just want to make sure that I'm prepared for whatever comes my way.  Any suggestions?  I'd love to hear any advice you may have...

564,564,2922061,1,44,"       I probably should not write this. I will only write it once. But it has been nagging me for two months now. I hope I'm wrong -- I pray I'm wrong. But I think we muffed the Iraq campaign of the War on Terror.  We lost it at the end of April, to be precise, in Fallujah. Our soldiers and Marines did wonderfully. Our political leaders failed us. All the good will we have, all the hard work of reconstruction our people are doing, even the rise of a democratic Iraq, won't make our enemies forget our leadership blinked that day. Whatever may come in Iraq, and I hope for the best, we have lost, and I predict history will mark Fallujah as the place of our defeat.  Probably most Americans already have forgotten. Since then we've had Abu Ghraib and the 9/11 commission and a thousand distractions. But that non-battle of Fallujah won't leave me. Remember? The mob slaughtered our citizens and mutilated their remains and strung them up from bridge trestles like meat. Our leaders vowed to go into that city and track down the killers and quell the insurgency.  The mess in Fallujah in April set a collision course between our two main goals in Iraq:  1.  convincing West-hating Islamic terrorists that we will defeat them and kill them without tiring, and  2.  convincing average Iraqis that it really is their country now, and setting them up in self-rule.  We ended up seeking a mixed solution. But more and more it becomes clear to me that the second goal was impossible without achieving the first. And we failed to accomplish the first goal at Fallujah, our best chance. Since then, things have only gotten worse.  By April 27, the Marines had the Battle of Fallujah half won. Individual Marines were writing home about it as a defining victory for their generation. They had an estimated 1,500 enemy hemmed in from the north and south, contained in the northeast corner of the city. This is an old-town warren of blind alleys and mosques. It could have been one big booby trap, like Jenin was for the Israelis. The USMC had begun handling it the correct way, with small probes that forced the enemy to react. When he showed, they killed. And over time, and attrition, they would have pinned the Islamist militias in a pocket, and then one big punch with overwhelming force would have ended it.  Three days later, in a surreal development, a defunct Republican Guard major general appeared, seemingly pulled from a hat, at the head of a newly formed Fallujah Protection Army. The USMC handed over control of Fallujah to him. The U.S. pulled back. Since then, the Sunni radicals and the Baathists have run Fallujah as a festering un-free free city within liberated Iraq. The clerics who have taken over Fallujah have installed a Taliban-style regime. Women who don't cover their hair and faces are beaten in the streets. Beauty parlors have been shut down. Men have been ordered to grow beards and barbers have been warned not to shave customers. Booze dealers have been flogged naked in the streets. Meanwhile, according to Chalabi, 'the terrorists in Fallujah are enjoying themselves, sending one car bomb after another.'  Better to have beat them down right there, where they chose to make their stand, with the cameras running and the world watching. Undoubtedly the jihadis would have fought suicidally, and taken many civilians with them. We backed off in part because of the bad PR that goes with killing people. Guess what? I'm willing to wager, based on history, that more people will die because we didn't finish that fight than would have died if we did. If the motive was to minimize death and mayhem, peace at any price was the wrong choice.  War is horrible. Like many horrible things, if it is to be done, it is best done as swiftly and firmly as possible. Do it with conviction, or don't do it. Else you simply drag and compound the horror.  For some people the horror of even the most careful war will simply be intolerable.  Very well. For others, anything done by a capitalist nation-state will send them tumbling out of their air-conditioned dorms into the streets with 'no blood for oil' signs.  The mewling and cries of 'atrocity' began even before the battle. Had we pursued victory into the city, the howl would have grown deafening. But a real leadership would have understood the stakes. The anti-war howlers think we're just a pack of oil-addicted baby-killers and torturers, or 'crusader' dupes of the Jews. They thought so before, they think so now. Holding back our hand, as we did in Fallujah, certainly won us no friends.  The last editorial I wrote for my newspaper was in April, as the Fallujah battle gathered. 'Start-and-stop drives against the insurgents in Fallujah and al-Sadr's brigades suggest our leaders have failed to learn the bitter lesson of '91,' it said. 'Our forbearance in such situations only is interpreted as weakness by the enemy. ... War is a brutal, bloody, destructive business. People who understand that -- Sherman, Patton -- are not men you would want for your secretaries of state in peacetime. But they succeed at war. Victory first; unconditional victory. Then mercy.'  They never ran it. I never have been asked to write another. My newspaper's editors are relentlessly against Bush and 'his' war. Michael Moore and Noam Chomsky are heroes here. In the newsroom that week, we had many stories to work on. But in the crucial places in the Middle East, all eyes were on Fallujah.   In the Middle East, as far back as Alexander, battles have been fought as much by bluff as by blood. They called our bluff, and we blinked. We began the battle, then we left it. Were we really serious about this Iraqi venture? We swept the Taliban from Kabul, we danced over Saddam's army, but the Islamists had reason to doubt our commitment. We blinked. And they know it.  Some of our leaders say it's better that Fallujah played out this way, because now it can be a rat-trap for the insurgents, where we can watch them and isolate them. To an extent, that is true. But the other alternative would have been far better. No matter how we spin this, the jihadis call it a victory, and their recruits across the Islamic world proclaim it one. And they're essentially right. The most potent army in the world said it was going to go in there and kill them, but they're still standing.  Now they know they will just have to outwait us, to keep the heat on us, and eventually, though much more slowly, Iraq will be Mogadishu and Beirut. They know that, even after the slaughter of Sept. 11, we lack the will and patience for a long, real war on terror. They also know they do not lack these qualities.  Now comes the storm. If Fallujah represents the watershed moment in the Iraq war, and I'm afraid it does, then this  is  another Vietnam. And it will have not only the effect of drawing more recruits to the terrorists (now that we have revealed we aren't serious about exterminating them), but it also will have consequences for the next time U.S. men and women go into battle. They'll not only have to think ahead to their enemies, but look over their shoulders to see if the politicians aren't going to pull the rug out from under them when they're halfway to victory (or, worse, dead in a fight they thought was going to save America).  Furthermore, the suspicion of our enemies has been reinforced that Americans don't do urban battles. And this is an awful because that kind of fighting is not an aberration in modern warfare. It  is  modern warfare. The world is urbanized in a degree impossible to conceive 100 years ago. Tank battles like Kursk, open-field maneuver like Normandy, that's all as 'ancient history' as Cannae.  After Vietnam, as bad as that was, the Western nuclear deterrent kept the Soviets back and gave us a decade to nurse the military and social hangover. We don't have that luxury with these enemies. The Islamists are at least holding their own against us so far in this war. And the breakdown of the international system of nuclear weapons containment (which began to crumble in the 1990s) is going to give our vicious enemies a serious equalizer in a few years. The West had better get its shit together, and I mean the French and the Germans and the American universities as well as us cowboys.  It may well be that, come November, all those 'anybody but Bush' voters will wake up with big grins caked on their faces because their nemesis is gone. But guess what? 'Bushie Boy' may go, but Jihadi boy will still be here, times ten thousand, and following our troops home. Then what are you going to do? Then it's your problem. Trotsky had the right line for these people: 'You may not be interested in war, but war is very interested in you.'  Do you think they'll let up on us if we have a president who speaks French and says nice things about the World Court? Do you think it matters to them that he wants to 'consult with our allies?' They want to blow up our allies, too. The hell they unleashed on us three years ago was planned while amiable Bill Clinton was still in the White House, urging Israeli concessions and trying to give the Palestinians a real nation.  Yet still, today, our press and politicians are fixated with the parsing out the details of the decision to overthrow Saddam, more than a year ago. Let history debate that. The war's begun. It doesn't matter what was the right decision then, unless you have a time machine. The right decision now, is what matters.  But we've completely lost that. Domestically, the country is heading into 1968 again. The 'baby-killer' shouts already have been heard by returning soldiers. As odious as I find Bush, I can't yet stand on the other side, so long as its pre-eminent message is crocodile tears over American loss and failure and death. I think we're going to see enough of that -- the real thing, not the manufactured version -- in years to come.  I need Kerry to do something -- anything -- to convince me he understands the seriousness of this situation better than the current incumbent does. I see nothing like that from him. In fact, I can't even see him at all, because right now there's a fat, stupid white man clotting up the election. Kerry is so devoid of a message that his campaign has been hijacked by a damned movie.  And, no, my practical pessimism is not the same thing as the media's, which is a far darker and more traitorious commodity -- infected with the Chomskyite poison that views any exercise of power by a capitalist nation-state as always evil and any resistance to it inherently good.  I will keep working for a free Iraq, in every way I can. I will give time and money, and lend my words and support to the good people in that country and the good people in my own who are working to set them on the path to freedom. I try to keep a generally positive even-keel attitude. This is a war, after all, and this is a democracy, after all, and everything is, at least in theory, a co-operative effort. Even if most of my fellow citizens persist in acting like it's a gladiator match in which the president does the work and we sit in the stands and point our thumbs.          ",5600,1000,I probably should not write this I will only write it once But it has been nagging me for two months now I hope I'm wrong I pray I'm wrong But I think we muffed the Iraq campaign of the War on Terror We lost it at the end of April to be precise in Fallujah Our soldiers and Marines did wonderfully Our political leaders failed us All the good will we have all the hard work of reconstruction our people are doing even the rise of a democratic Iraq won't make our enemies forget our leadership blinked that day Whatever may come in Iraq and I hope for the best we have lost and I predict history will mark Fallujah as the place of our defeat Probably most Americans already have forgotten Since then we've had Abu Ghraib and the commission and a thousand distractions But that non-battle of Fallujah won't leave me Remember The mob slaughtered our citizens and mutilated their remains and strung them up from bridge trestles like meat Our leaders vowed to go into that city and track down the killers and quell the insurgency The mess in Fallujah in April set a collision course between our two main goals in Iraq convincing West-hating Islamic terrorists that we will defeat them and kill them without tiring and convincing average Iraqis that it really is their country now and setting them up in self-rule We ended up seeking a mixed solution But more and more it becomes clear to me that the second goal was impossible without achieving the first And we failed to accomplish the first goal at Fallujah our best chance Since then things have only gotten worse By April the Marines had the Battle of Fallujah half won Individual Marines were writing home about it as a defining victory for their generation They had an estimated enemy hemmed in from the north and south contained in the northeast corner of the city This is an old-town warren of blind alleys and mosques It could have been one big booby trap like Jenin was for the Israelis The USMC had begun handling it the correct way with small probes that forced the enemy to react When he showed they killed And over time and attrition they would have pinned the Islamist militias in a pocket and then one big punch with overwhelming force would have ended it Three days later in a surreal development a defunct Republican Guard major general appeared seemingly pulled from a hat at the head of a newly formed Fallujah Protection Army The USMC handed over control of Fallujah to him The U.S pulled back Since then the Sunni radicals and the Baathists have run Fallujah as a festering un-free free city within liberated Iraq The clerics who have taken over Fallujah have installed a Taliban-style regime Women who don't cover their hair and faces are beaten in the streets Beauty parlors have been shut down Men have been ordered to grow beards and barbers have been warned not to shave customers Booze dealers have been flogged naked in the streets Meanwhile according to Chalabi the terrorists in Fallujah are enjoying themselves sending one car bomb after another Better to have beat them down right there where they chose to make their stand with the cameras running and the world watching Undoubtedly the jihadis would have fought suicidally and taken many civilians with them We backed off in part because of the bad PR that goes with killing people Guess what I'm willing to wager based on history that more people will die because we didn't finish that fight than would have died if we did If the motive was to minimize death and mayhem peace at any price was the wrong choice War is horrible Like many horrible things if it is to be done it is best done as swiftly and firmly as possible Do it with conviction or don't do it Else you simply drag and compound the horror For some people the horror of even the most careful war will simply be intolerable Very well For others anything done by a capitalist nation-state will send them tumbling out of their air-conditioned dorms into the streets with no blood for oil signs The mewling and cries of atrocity began even before the battle Had we pursued victory into the city the howl would have grown deafening But a real leadership would have understood the stakes The anti-war howlers think we're just a pack of oil-addicted baby-killers and torturers or crusader dupes of the Jews They thought so before they think so now Holding back our hand as we did in Fallujah certainly won us no friends The last editorial I wrote for my newspaper was in April as the Fallujah battle gathered Start-and-stop drives against the insurgents in Fallujah and al-Sadr's brigades suggest our leaders have failed to learn the bitter lesson of it said Our forbearance in such situations only is interpreted as weakness by the enemy War is a brutal bloody destructive business People who understand that Sherman Patton are not men you would want for your secretaries of state in peacetime But they succeed at war Victory first unconditional victory Then mercy They never ran it I never have been asked to write another My newspaper's editors are relentlessly against Bush and his war Michael Moore and Noam Chomsky are heroes here In the newsroom that week we had many stories to work on But in the crucial places in the Middle East all eyes were on Fallujah In the Middle East as far back as Alexander battles have been fought as much by bluff as by blood They called our bluff and we blinked We began the battle then we left it Were we really serious about this Iraqi venture We swept the Taliban from Kabul we danced over Saddam's army but the Islamists had reason to doubt our commitment We blinked And,135,test
572,572,2922061,1,44,"       Many people I read and respect in the Blogosphere have an attack-dog reaction to the name 'Chomsky.' But people who mock and dismiss him should read him first. They may find much that will have them nodding in agreement.  Chomsky's politics are execrable, and his world-view is warped. But one aspect of his spiel is a critique of media bias. And it's worth reading.   He does actually do something for a living, beside discover how Everything is America's Fault. He's a linguist, but not a nuts-and-bolts type who studies the structures of languages and how they evolved. You can read dozens of the best books on that topic (as I have) without ever encountering his name.  Chomsky's work is in a more theoretical realm: language as something that happens inside the human brain. He develops and tests theories about how grammar happens, on the subconscious level. It's really more psychology than linguistics, I think.  His observations about human behavior are often insightful. And he has studied the media carefully. And guess what? He thinks it's badly biased. So do a lot of people who don't agree with him about almost anything else. But while his opponents tend to regard media bias as a 'given,' an article of faith that doesn't have to be explained, Chomsky has carefully gone about explaining how it happens.  He writes ably about how the 'elite media' set the agenda for the rest. By 'elite media' he means generally the same set of names the rest of us do -- The New York Times, CBS, the handful of corporations on that plane.  Now, here's the rub: to Chomsky, these media are biased because they're  too conservative.  OK, when you stop laughing, please note that his analysis of the system, of the method by which the slant becomes institutionalized, is politics-neutral. It can as easily explain any sort of bias -- against the war, for white people, against religion, for cheap beer. It can even be applied to Chomsky himself, who is a media phenomenon.  The idea of 'manufactured consent,' which Chomsky rides hard in his writing on the media, likewise does not imply an ideology. He describes it like this: 'We [i.e. the media] can make it [people's right to vote] irrelevant because we can manufacture consent and make sure that their choices and attitudes will be structured in such a way that they will always do what we tell them, even if they have a formal way to participate. So we'll have a real democracy. It will work properly.'  I found this in a piece by Chomsky published by Z Media Institute in June 1997.   There is another sector of the media, the elite media, sometimes called the agenda-setting media because they are the ones with the big resources, they set the framework in which everyone else operates. The New York Times and CBS, that kind of thing. Their audience is mostly privileged people. The people who read the New York Times -- people who are wealthy or part of what is sometimes called the political class -- they are actually involved in the political system in an ongoing fashion. They are basically managers of one sort or another. They can be political managers, business managers (like corporate executives or that sort of thing), doctoral managers (like university professors), or other journalists who are involved in organizing the way people think and look at things.  The elite media set a framework within which others operate. If you are watching the Associated Press, who grind out a constant flow of news, in the mid-afternoon it breaks and there is something that comes along every day that says 'Notice to Editors: Tomorrow's New York Times is going to have the following stories on the front page.' The point of that is, if you're an editor of a newspaper in Dayton, Ohio and you don't have the resources to figure out what the news is, or you don't want to think about it anyway, this tells you what the news is. These are the stories for the quarter page that you are going to devote to something other than local affairs or diverting your audience. These are the stories that you put there because that's what the New York Times tells us is what you're supposed to care about tomorrow.  If you are an editor in Dayton, Ohio, you would sort of have to do that, because you don't have much else in the way of resources. If you get off line, if you're producing stories that the big press doesn't like, you'll hear about it pretty soon. ... So there are a lot of ways in which power plays can drive you right back into line if you move out. If you try to break the mold, you're not going to last long. That framework works pretty well, and it is understandable that it is just a reflection of obvious power structures.   OK, well, that's not quite right, but it wouldn't be Chomsky if he got it quite right. The New York Times sends out a wire item every afternoon slugged 'AM-PAGE1-CONSIDER-NYT.' It tells what the paper's top stories will be for the next day, and it goes only to subscribers of the New York Times wire, which is a different thing than the AP wire. But the AP also sends out its page 1 recommendations every day, and, with the exception of enterprise pieces that one or the other is working on, the list is essentially the same for the AP and the NYT.  I work as a copy editor for a small-city Pennsylvania newspaper (Dayton would be a good comparison). On nights when I sit at the wire desk, I read the wires and put together my 'page one recommendation' lists, and pitch those stories at our daily budget meeting. I always have done this without reference to the AP and NYT recommendations. But it doesn't matter. My boss, the editor, always checks the AP tip sheet, and also looks to see what 'the boys on 42nd Street' are doing in their newspaper, and no matter what I recommend, he adjusts his story choices accordingly.  The next day, we see the WaPo, NYT, Philly Inquirer, etc. And nothing makes my boss more pleased than to see that his front page design that morning is exactly like theirs. Same stories, same pictures, same placement. That proves, to him, that he has 'good news judgment.' It proves he belongs in the same league as the big boys. My pitching other stories, instead of some of those on the 'recommendation' list, confirms my boss in the belief that I lack good news judgment. I don't want to make this personal, but I am pretty sure it's one reason he's never left me to run the newspaper on days when he's away.  So who is this boss? If you read down the posts on this blog you'll get a beginning of a picture. He doesn't read much more than what is on the newswires, but to him, there was no sane connection between Iraq and the terror attacks of Sept. 11, and therefore the war to overthrow Saddam was illegal and unjust. To him, stories about death and chaos and American failure in occupied Iraq are 'what the readers want,' and any other kind of stories are irrelevant.  But of course my boss would deny that his agreement with NYT coverage was evidence of a 'bias,' which, after all, is a word freighted with menace and subterfuge. He would deny that it is part of a systematic inclination in the media. Chomsky anticipates this, and anticipates the response.    They say, quite correctly, 'nobody ever tells me what to write. I write anything I like. All this business about pressures and constraints is nonsense because I'm never under any pressure.' Which is completely true, but the point is that they wouldn't be there unless they had already demonstrated that nobody has to tell them what to write because they are going say the right thing. If they had started off at the Metro desk, or something, and had pursued the wrong kind of stories, they never would have made it to the positions where they can now say anything they like.   And that's essentially correct. And it works as well to explain a 'liberal' bias as a (presumed) conservative one. Even Chomsky says this, in discussing why this whole topic is taboo in journalism schools. 'Again, it is not purposeful censorship. It is just that you don't make it to those positions.  That includes the left (what is called the left), as well as the right.  Unless you have been adequately socialized and trained so that there are some thoughts you just don't have, because if you did have them, you wouldn't be there.' [italics added]  Of course, Chomsky also goes on to say, in this article, that the agenda-setting media  are controlled by corporations, and thus by a corporate structure that he compares to fascism. He goes on to say that this means the news agendas are set by wealthy, parasitic elites, to protect their interest. He talks about propaganda and world domination. He is Chomsky, after all. Along the way he makes the astonishing observation that, 'The U.S. [before World War I] was a very pacifist country. It has always been.'  But if you can peel away the paranoia and focus on the media critique, and the explanation of the system by which it happens, you can learn something useful from Chomsky sometimes.

575,575,2922061,1,44,"       My newspaper, which has access to both AP and New York Times news wires, ran the AP version of the Senate Intelligence Committee report story Saturday morning on page A1 above the fold, with the headline  'Report: CIA analysis was false' .  It's chock full of quotes, mostly from thundering Democratic politicians, and has the adjectives 'scathing,' 'false,' and 'unfounded' in the lede. It goes on at length about the debate over whether there was Bush administration 'pressure' to 'overplay the Iraq threat.'  On the same day, inside and alongside the jump from the Intelligence Committee report story, we ran  'Blair braces for potentially damaging report on Iraqi intelligence' . This is the AP story about the inquiry into the British intelligence on Iraq, which is to be released Wednesday. The article focuses almost entirely on the '45-minute' claim.  Curiously, it says nothing about Bush's supposedly discredited claim that Saddam tried to buy uranium from Niger. This, of course, is one of the main pillars of the 'Bush lied' meme. The Democratic National Committee even issued a press releases about it, titled 'President Bush Deceives The American People.' The spat made an anti-war hero of Joseph C. Wilson IV, the man the CIA sent to Africa to investigate the uranium claim.  What is even more odd about the absence of this item from the coverage of Lord Butler's report on British intelligence is that, because when Bush made the claim, he credited it to British intelligence:   'The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.'   In fact, in the local newspapers this weekend, I found mention of it only in the afternoon paper (the one I don't work for), which on Friday ran an earlier edition of the same AP story on the Intelligence Committee, under the same byline (Katherine Pfleger Shrader). In the fifth paragraph it mentions the uranium: 'It [the Senate Intelligence Committee report] faulted Tenet for not personally reviewing Bush's 2003 State of the Union address, which contained since-discredited references to Iraq's attempts to purchase uranium in Africa.'  So, if you were getting your news from the Lancaster, Pennsylvania, newspapers, you'd never know that the Niger-uranium claim has in fact been  given a substantial credibility boost,  and that it comes in  both the Senate committee report  and in  Lord Butler's report on British intelligence.   According to the Senate report, Wilson's trip to Africa did not 'discredit' the story that Iraq was shopping for uranium in Niger -- it strengthened it, because Wilson reported that an Iraqi delegation had traveled to Niger in 1999 and that Niger officials believed that they were interested in buying uranium.  Lord Butler's report is a mixed bag of praise and censure for the Blair government. But among its conclusions -- and this has been percolating in the British papers since well before Thursday, when the AP began writing its stories -- it says the statements about Iraq and Niger are justified and supported by the intelligence.  You might know about this development, however, if you read blogs like Instapundit and LGF. Or if you follow the work of  urlLink  Mark Steyn;     The fact is almost every European intelligence service reckoned Saddam was trying to buy uranium in Africa. The only folks who didn't think so were the CIA.  Let's weigh their comparative interest in the story. The Financial Times revealed last week that one continental intelligence agency had had a uranium-smuggling operation involving Iraq under surveillance for three years. In return, the only primary investigation initiated by the most powerful nation on the face of the Earth was to send a narcissistic kook from a Saudi-funded think-tank on vacation for a week to sip mint tea with government stooges. He didn't even bother filing a written report, and the ''Bush spurned my advice!'' column he wrote for the Times reads like a bad travelogue: ''Through the haze, I could see camel caravans crossing the Niger river.'' After that, the great narcissist somehow managed to make himself the center of the story -- But hey, enough about Saddam's nuclear ambitions; let's talk about me.  A few weeks before 9/11, Reuel Marc Gerecht wrote a timely piece in the Atlantic Monthly on the woeful state of U.S. counter-terrorism intelligence in a CIA neutered by politically correct bureaucracy. Among Gerecht's many memorable quotes was this line from a young CIA man reflecting on an agency grown used to desk-bound life in Virginia: ''Operations that include diarrhea as a way of life don't happen.'' That's Niger in a nutshell: Diarrhea Central. Who'd want to be stationed there when they could be back at Langley monitoring the world's e-mail in an air-conditioned office?  But Niger is a 99.5 percent Sunni Muslim country with the world's second highest birth rate and a load of uranium. It's exactly the sort of place an intelligence agency in the war on terror ought to be keeping an eye on. And that doesn't mean sending Mint Tea Boy to write it up for the travel section.   ...  Bush didn't LIE!!!! He was right, and the CIA were wrong. That doesn't mean they LIED!!!! either. Intelligence is never 100 percent. You make a judgment, and in this instance the judgments of the British and Europeans were right, and the judgment of the principal intelligence agency of the world's hyperpower was wrong. That should be a cause of great concern -- for all Americans.  National security shouldn't be a Republican/Democrat thing. But it's become one because, for too many Americans, when it's a choice between Bush and anybody else, they'll take anybody else. So, in 'Fahrenheit 9/11,' if it's a choice between Bush and Saddam, Michael Moore comes down on the side of the genocidal whacko and shows us lyrical slo-mo shots of kiddies flying kites in a Baathist utopia. In the Afghan war, if it's a choice between Bush and the women-enslaving gay-executing Taliban, Susan Sarandon and Co. side with the Taliban. And in the most exquisite reductio of this now universal rule, if it's a choice between Bush and the CIA, the left sides with the CIA.    Which I've noticed, too, of course. The resident ultra-left in the newsroom, one of whom actually went to Central America in the Reagan era (props for that) and worked with the people, is now defending the CIA. It seems to shock even him to hear his voice say these things. He explains the spies are a necessary force for the protection of America, and the poor put-upon CIA ought to be protected from the evil menace that is the constitutional presidency. (OK, that's my interpretation).  The anti-war movement's focus on WMD is highly self-serving. By focusing on the absence -- so far -- of the discovery of a large cache of them, and on the intelligence gaffes, makes the war opponents seem as if they were right all along.  But this disguises the fact that, before the war began, many if not most of them believed it, too. That is, opponents of the war, both in the U.S. and abroad, didn't oppose it because they thought there were no WMD in Iraq. Sometimes they opposed war exactly because they were afraid of what Saddam and his WMD might do. But, as Michael Moore says, Americans are the stupidest people in the world, so apparently his side is counting on all of us to forget what they all said a year and a half ago.  As for those of us who supported it, I don't know any who did so  solely  based on the presence of huge stocks of WMD. It was always presented as a guess (with more or less confidence), but for me that was only part of a multi-level decision that the invasion was the right thing to do, for both Iraqis and Americans and everyone else in the world except fascist dictators and Islamist terrorists.  Meanwhile,  urlLink  Winds of Change   dresses down Joe Wilson -- and this is one of the kinder cuts I've read -- thusly:   Joe Wilson is a liar and not a particularly good one at that. As the report, starting on p. 39 and going through p. 47 very carefully explains, the claims that Wilson during his media blitz and subsequent canonization as a representative of all that is righteous and pure within anti-war circles were every bit as misleading if not factually inaccurate as anything that one may charge that the administration had done. Even more so, I would argue, if only for the fact that he was making claims about a number of issues, for example the forged documents referring to Niger, of which he had no actual knowledge - a very polite way of saying that the man was blowing smoke out his ass.

576,576,2922061,1,44,"        urlLink  This article   explores, in an oddly offhand way, the tension between the sensuality of belly-dance -- a delicious, ancient, and characteristically Middle Eastern art -- and the prudish anti-sensuality of Islamist fundamentalism.  The topic of the article is the decision by Egypt's state-owned TV to ban music videos where women bare their belly-buttons. The decision was taken in the name of 'their daughter's morals.' Egypt is not a theocracy, but its government rides a tiger of fundamentalism, and knows how to throw the beast a bone from time to time.  So far, the article reports, 700 videos have been banned, mainly Lebanese productions (the 'exuberantly nubile Lebanese singer Nancy Agram' is singled out in the article) but also some Egyptian ones (a local girl named Rubi has drawn the ire of Cairo's fundamentalists).    But lest we accuse Egypt of being alarmist or old-fashioned, it's worth noting that American television imposed a similar restriction in the midst of the permissive Sixties. Curiously, a sitcom inspired by the 1001 Nights elicited the navel ban. I Dream of Genie [sic] was a classic piece of sexist kitsch featuring a curvy actress wearing a jewelled bra and gauzy pants that started out as hip-huggers and ended up around her waist.     There are two problems with this (besides not knowing how to spell 'Jeannie'). One is that America in the 1960s was gradually lowering its collective dress code. TV was the final frontier. It was a long slog from Audrey Hepburn to Goldie Hawn. The 'permissive Sixties' didn't open with a starter's pistol at dawn on Jan. 1, 1960.  The Barbara Eden series (1965) came along right at the time when women's exposed navels in public were the frontier of the rising tide of sexual liberation. After her came the bizarre era of the 'occasional navel' rule, whereby censors would allow a bare belly-button in one scene if the same girl, in another scene in the same outfit, had it covered (you can see that in old 'Gilligan's Island' and 'Star Trek' episodes). After that came Cher, and 'Laugh-In,' and the TV belly-button floodgates were open, never to close.  A belly-button is, as the observant anthropologist Desmond Morris has pointed out, a miniature image of vagina. John Updike published a perfect little short story in 1961 called 'A&P,' which is essentially about a young man who works in a stuffy grocery store at the shore when three girls walk in, one of them in a two-piece suit, and the sight and idea of her, and her boss's reaction to her (lack of) attire drives him into open teen-male rebellion. The girls on the covers of the mid-'60s 'Playboys' sported provocatively bare bellies in their hiphugger stretch pants. If you've ever read anything about how the 'Playboy' empire operates, you'll know that those covers are scrupulously constructed to be deliberate ideograms of sexual suggestion.  The other problem is that, while Barbara Eden couldn't show her navel in a prime-time TV show, she could, and did, show it in other contexts -- as a young bikini model (it's easy to forget, given how annoying she later became as a perennial Merv Griffen guest, that she was good fun back in the day). She could walk down the beach in a two-piece suit without having to worry about being accosted by religious freaks. In Egypt, since at least as far back as 'I Dream of Jeannie,' belly-dancers have been forbidden to bare their bellies and navels. Sheer or flesh-colored nylons are allowed, but no bare bellies on belly-dancers. And, according to the article, 'Rubi the singing and dancing sex bomb, ... must endure the company of campus security guards while attending class.'  Other cultures appreciate and have eroticized the female navel. In Japan, young women commonly pay $2,000 for navel-reconstruction surgery to get an ideal belly-button -- which in that culture is 'vertical, very narrow, and absolutely symmetrical.' The navel goes to the core of Japaneses culture, says author Hogen Fukunaga. 'The navel is the core of everything about the person,' Fukunaga wrote in a book about how a navel's shape can diagnose one's ills. Scholars write treatises on the navel, such as the recent 'Poetic Reflection on the Navel.'   Middle Eastern and Indian culture also respect the belly as a vital center, the place where we all first were connected to life, through the navel. Its importance is reflected in the ancient art and literature of the Middle East and South Asia, which placed great emphasis on women's bellies. In Arab countries, as in Japan, there is a navel aesthetic: A large, hollow navel is regarded as beautiful and is considered lucky.   Like its brother religion, Christianity (and to a lesser extent Judaism), Islam often takes a harsh view of sexuality, and of women's sexuality especially. It seems to associate overt celebration of female sexuality with Islam's ancient enemy, polytheism. Probably this is because old paganisms often were matriarchal at their core, and, as was the case with Christianity in Europe, the goddess rituals naturally proved the most difficult to co-opt or extinguish.  In ancient India, the yantra is a downward-pointing triangle, a sacred female image, and the strongest version of the symbol is the Kali yantra. It represents shakti: the life force, cosmic energy experienced as female. And there is a navel-like dot at the center space, called the bindo, or 'seed of life.' Likewise, an image of Astarte, the Near Eastern fertility and sexuality goddess, in gold from Syro-Palestine c.1600-1500 B.C.E. reduces the goddess to only a simple face, a sacred triangle, and a navel. Her name itself means 'Womb' or 'Belly;' in Hebrew, she was called 'Tamar.'   A navel is the symbolic focal point of the mazes and labyrinths that dot much of the ancient landscapes of the Mediterranean. Francis Huxley ('The Way of the Sacred,' 1974) writes: 'He who knows how to follow or make the diagram has his passport to the other world and resides in God -- or rather, because the maze honors women and the belly, the Goddess.' Mazes and labyrinths were found in the palaces of Minoan Crete, the most goddess-centered of all the early cultures, and are engraved on their coins, with the entrance at the bottom, representing the vulva, and the seat of the goddess in the center, the navel. These mazes were not places to get lost, but rather pathways to journey through on the way to the ritual space.   There once was an omphalos, or 'navel-shrine,' where the prophetic priestess of the Earth Goddess dwelt at Delphi before patriarchal religion converted the place to the service of Apollo. So patriarchal a figure as Aeschylus recorded that Gaia was the first to be worshipped at Delphi, followed by her daughters Themis and Phoebe. Asherah, one Canaanite form of the Goddess worshipped by the early Hebrews, was a daughter of Astarte. Asherah had a shrine at Shechem, mentioned in the Old Testament, known as the 'navel of the land,' which has been compared to Delphi.  This part of a woman's body naturally was prominent in the ritual erotic dances that were part of her religion, and which have come down, much disguised and altered, in modern belly-dance. Even detached from its origins, the modern belly-dance embodies a heady eroticism that can transcend narrow cultural perceptions of age, physical beauty, and sensuality. But clearly these ancient belly-dances had originally a magical, mystical power. The poet Ram Prasad, addressing Kali, wrote, 'My heart is five lotuses. You building these five into one, dance and swell in my mind.' In Turkish, one of the words for 'dance' is a variation of the word  boyu,  which means 'magic, witchcraft.'  In part, too, the Middle Eastern repression of belly-dance may reflect a jealous regard for women's sexuality in a culture where women are a sort of property, to be bartered between families and hidden in harems. In this case, it is not so much a matter of what a woman does in her body, but of not crossing the line between public and private. And a desexualized woman, obviously, is easier to control.  'Many and subtle are the forms of violence to which Egyptian women have grown inured,' the article notes. 'On the unsubtle side we have Mohammed Omar, columnist for the state-owned daily Al-Akhbar, who maintains that only ugly women attract abuse and every man '[has] the right to do what [abusive] men have done.' '  So we should recuse ourselves from judging the Egyptian situation as 'alarmist or old-fashioned' (I'd call it harsher things) because of what happened on our TV screens in 1965. That strikes me as a shoddy attempt at pre-emptive moral equivalency.

579,579,2922061,1,44,"       By John Koopman c.2004 San Francisco Chronicle  BAGHDAD, Iraq -- Rwaida's death hit everyone hard.  Partly because she was a buddy they had known for a long time. Mostly, because she was an innocent, brutally slain for the simple reason that she worked for the Americans.  'Rwaida was a pal, she was a running buddy,' said Staff Sgt. Tom Kelly of New Orleans. In the Army, a running buddy is the best kind of friend. Someone you run with, hang out with.  Rwaida Al Shemre worked as an interpreter for the 3rd Battalion, 82nd Field Artillery Regiment in central Baghdad. On July 5, an Iraqi driver picked her up at her home and started toward the Army base near the airport. A car drove in front of them and blocked them in. Another pulled up behind. Someone approached the car and fired at Rwaida and the driver.  Rwaida was hit four times. She was shot once in the face. Another in the arm, a defensive wound. She died before she reached the hospital. She was 33.  Capt. Dave Minaschek, of Sierra Vista, Ariz., said soldiers are trying to find out who killed her. It means a lot to them, because Rwaida meant a lot to them.  This is the harsh reality for people who work with U.S. forces in Iraq. Some killings make the headlines, or the Internet. But many more happen on the streets and in the darkness, and almost no one knows about them.  Interpreters are particularly easy targets for insurgents, or anyone with a grudge against the U.S. forces. They are unarmed and often unguarded when they leave base.  The gunmen seem to target the female interpreters. Rwaida was one of four interpreters killed in the central and southern part of the city in the last two weeks.  Soldiers with the Army's Brigade Combat Team 5 said a female interpreter was kidnapped as she left the front gate in mid-July. Her father was killed in the street and she was taken away, only to be found dead later.  'God knows what they did to her,' said one soldier who knew of the incident.  Some interpreters live with the soldiers in the Forward Operating Bases. Others live off-base. They all take great care to hide their identities while they translate exchanges between the Americans and Iraqis. Some men wear bandannas over their faces, and the women pull head scarves down low.  Some wear body armor; most don't. They never use their real names at work; the soldiers refer to them by American names like 'Doris' or 'Eric.' Rwaida went by 'Sally.'  No one seems to know where she learned English. Kelly said Rwaida had a brother in Canada, and often added 'eh?' to her sentences.  Rwaida, a hairdresser, first worked for the Army unit that preceded this one at the base. Capt. James Zoizack of the 4th Battalion, 1st Field Artillery, 1st Armored Division, heard her call out a greeting when he was on patrol and talked her into coming to work for the Americans. She made good money at it, by Iraqi standards: about $400 a month.  When she was working with Zoizack's unit, she once saw that a man had pulled a gun and was about to shoot an American. She tried to push the soldier out of the way, Kelly said, and ended up with a flesh wound in her abdomen.  When 3rd Battalion, 82nd Field Artillery came along, she became the interpreter. And she was a good one, Kelly said. She did more than just translate Arabic into English, he said, she explained things to both Iraqis and Americans. If she thought an Iraqi contractor was trying to cheat or lie, or if she heard one Iraqi tell another to cheat or lie in front of the soldiers, she would say so.  The soldiers learned to count on her for more than just language skills.  'She was one of us,' Kelly said.  If a soldier was sick, Rwaida would bring a special Iraqi soup, the local version of chicken soup, to make him better.  She was a single mother. Her husband had left her not long after her daughter was born. She had sent her 10-year-old daughter to live in Jordan with a sister while she worked for the Americans. Soldiers would flirt with her, ask her if she would consider marrying an American.  'How much money you got, eh?' she would ask, then laugh.  But working with the Americans, and perhaps because she was an assertive woman in an area where women are supposed to be docile, she caught the attention of various Iraqis. There were veiled threats. Sometimes soldiers would notice a certain body language between her and the Iraqis. Later, Rwaida would tell the soldiers that she had been asked things like, 'Why are you working for the Americans?' and 'Where do you live?' or 'Don't I know you, what's your name?'  At least twice, she was threatened outright: 'Don't work with the coalition,' Capt. Minaschek said.  She never listened. But she did make plans to leave the country to make a better life for her daughter. She had gotten papers to move to Canada to live with her brother and was preparing to leave at the end of the year, after the battalion returns to the United States.  'She said she liked the battalion and she didn't want to leave while we were still here,' Kelly said. 'She didn't even want to leave Iraq, really. She said she wanted to come back in a couple of years and live here.'  The day of her death, the news stunned the soldiers. At first they heard that she had been wounded, and the driver killed. They rushed to the hospital and found a harried doctor.  Where could they find Al Shemre?  'That one is dead,' the doctor said.  The soldiers stood in stunned silence. They asked to see her body and were taken to the morgue.  'She was laid out on the floor,' Kelly said. 'We told them to put her on a bed. Her family was on their way to see her.'  The soldiers put together a memorial ceremony at their compound. Dozens showed up, including 15 members of her family -- her daughter Doa'a; her mother; two sisters; a brother; and various cousins. Off at the side was a table with a photo of Rwaida and some of her belongings.  When a soldier dies in combat, his or her comrades walk past the memorial -- usually a rifle stuck in the ground with helmet on top -- and salute. After Rwaida's ceremony ended, the soldiers walked past the table and saluted.  'Her death hit me harder than anything I've experienced over here,' said Capt. Evans Hanson of Houston, who worked closely with her.  'Rwaida went out with troops hundreds of times and faced dangers everywhere she went,' Hanson said at her memorial service. 'She looked powerful men in the eye and faced them without fear, because she knew they were up to no good. No one could say she wasn't a strong woman.'  But she had a soft side, too.  'Near a school in Yarmouk, we found a family living between mud walls with no food or shelter,' Hanson said. 'Sgt. Kelly asked if we should stop and help. I callously said, 'Forget it. We can't help everyone. All we have is toothpaste anyway.'  'Rwaida said, 'No, help them a little bit just!' That day, we made some lasting friends just by listening a little. Rwaida taught me how to care.'  Two days after Rwaida was killed, a young woman showed up, looking for a job as an interpreter. Kelly interviewed her.  'I felt like I had to explain the situation, and make sure she understood the danger,' Kelly said. 'I told her that a previous interpreter had just been killed. She just said, 'God will protect me.''  The new interpreter, who the soldiers call Nadia, studied English at a local university. She's 22, the oldest of four children, the only girl. She wants to go to the United States someday.  'I am not afraid,' she said. 'I know this is my duty and that I should do that.'  She said she appreciates the money she earns, but the amount is not material. 'Morals should be the most important thing for everyone.'  'I have great respect for the Christian people,' she said. 'They respect God and I love God. Too many Muslims hurt each other.'

586,586,2922061,1,44,"       You think it's ugly now; just wait.  Tom Ridge says al Qaida may be entering the 'operational or planning phase of an attack,' yearning to hit America hard sometime before Election Day.  Since Sept. 11, only the most paranoid fringe players have asserted the cynical theory that the Bush Administration knew what was going to happen that day and let it happen for the sake of some agenda. Rather, Bush has been condemned for his clueless, slack-jawed response. Next time, if it comes, it will be different. If I'm right, the anti-war voices already are staking out their positions on the grassy knoll, ready to open fire with the lurid assertion that 'Bush knew.'  The virulently anti-war, anti-Bush Guardian newspaper in Britain runs an occasional series under the heading 'Fortress America' Today's is titled  urlLink  George Bush's re-election hopes may well hang on al-Qaida's ruthless ingenuity.    The Guardian doesn't have the guts to come right out and say it. But the piece seems aimed at setting up a public suspicion that Bush knows an al Qaida attack -- gods forbid there should be one -- between now and November would assure his re-election, and that, if he has some inclination that one is coming, he might not try very hard to stop it. Here's the article's conclusion:    In a recent opinion poll for the Economist, handling the war on terror was one of the few areas in which American voters favoured Bush over Kerry. It seems likely there would be a wave of patriotic solidarity with the incumbent. In short, Bush's election chances may depend on the ruthless ingenuity of al-Qaida, while Kerry's election chances may depend on the ability of Bush's department of homeland security to combat it.     There's a paternalism in the institution of the presidency, and Americans will rally around an incumbent leader, even an unpopular one, in a national crisis. But the anti-war left has noticed that this can be thwarted, quickly and effectively, by deflecting the galvanizing effect of an attack into national anger at the administration. And their model is Spain.  'A major terrorist attack on the American homeland a few days before November 2 would almost certainly not have the effect that the Madrid pre-election bombing had, sending swing voters to the anti-war opposition,' the Guardian writes. No, an attack by itself wouldn't. But a scandalous revelation that the Bush administration had let it happen surely would, and the Guardian surely knows this. As do others in its camp. It needn't be a full revelation; in a nation as split and jittery as we are this year, a strong suspicion, shouted loudly enough by reputable sources, might suffice.  In Spain, voters tossed the U.S.-allied Aznar government just days after a major terrorist attack. Nobody accused Aznar of complicity in the attack. But, they say, he knew that if voters connected the deaths to his unpopular decision to take part in the war to overthrow Saddam, they would swing behind his opponent. Aznar, the pundits say, too quickly blamed the terror bombings on Basque groups. Al Qaida turned out to be the culprit. The national anguish at the vicious murder of almost 200 citizens galvanized into anger -- not at the killers, but at the government that named the wrong suspect.  The U.S. is not Spain; it's hard to imagine that sequence happening here. But you can't blame the Bush-bashers for dreaming of the anger of U.S. voters if Bush or his cabinet were believed to have cynically allowed Americans to die for the sake of an election.  And you have to think some people in high places are already rehearsing what they might say in the days between a terrorist attack on the U.S. and the next presidential election.  As despicable as that would be, the Guardian piece veers right off the track into tin-foil-hat territory by suggesting that Bush's self-interest converges with bin Laden's. 'Osama bin Laden ... must be backing an election victory for George Bush.'   The object of the terrorist is often to reveal the 'true' repressive character of the state against which the terror is directed, and thus win further support for the terrorists' cause. If the United States had just acted in Afghanistan, and then concentrated on hoovering-up the remains of al-Qaida, the United States might clearly be winning the war on terror today. But, as bin Laden must have hoped, the Bush administration overreacted, and thus provided, in Iraq and Guantánamo, recruiting sergeants for al-Qaida of which Osama could only dream.   'So in this looking-glass world of backhanded ironies ... al-Qaida terrorists will be backing Bush, because he's their best recruiter.' And in that view, the article reports, the terrorists may well try to influence the American election by timing an attack to boost Bush into another four-year term.  OK, overlook the howler about putting Afghanistan in one category and Guantanamo in another: the Guardian, which editorializes tirelessly against Guantanamo, doesn't seem to realize that 'the vast majority' of the detainees there were scooped up in the Afghan campaign.  The fact is, the Islamists don't need Bush's policies to bring in recruits. They have allies in mosques all around the world, tirelessly preaching Jihad, and filling the heads of uninformed young men with the most ludicrous lies about the U.S., the Jews, 9/11, you name it. If the U.S. had stopped with Afghanistan, the only difference would be that the outcry from the mosques and al Jazeera about human rights abuses, secret Mossad operations, and mass rapes of Muslim women by G.I.s would have been told about that country, rather than Iraq.  The Guardian doesn't document its suggestion that, the more America fights back, the more Muslims join the radicals. Perhaps in some cases that is so. But there is good anecdotal evidence from Iraq that our determined resistance to Islamist jihad dampens the enthusiasm of the enemy -- not all of them seem to want those 70 virgins right now. And a perception of our weakness, as in Fallujah, is regarded throughout the region as a wonderful gift to Islamist 'recruiters.'  You don't read about imams preaching, 'go fight the Americans, they hit back hard.' But you do hear a lot about them telling their followers how weak and decadent we are, for all our appearance of power. Fallujah, not Guantanamo, is their rallying cry.  As for Spain,  Iraq al-Jihad,  the al-Qaeda strategy document publicized after the Madrid bombings, shows that the terrorists didn't care a damn about the left-right nuances of the Popular Party and the Socialist Party. The Spanish elections were targeted for one reason: the Socialist Party had pledged, in its platform, to pull Spanish troops out of Iraq unless the U.S. got a U.N. mandate for them to be there.  To the Islamists, Spain was a soft ally that could be peeled away from the main target. And America is target number one. Al Qaida doesn't care that the 'bring the troops home now' crowd supports Kerry. Their war on us goes on no matter who sits in the White House. Al Qaida loathes America and the West, and while the Guardian's pundits inhabit a space where the gap between Bush and Kerry is as wide as America, to al Qaida, they're both the same; a different face on the Great Satan.   But speaking of Islamist 'recruiting,' in Spain this year Al Qaida determined the outcome of a European nation's election. It asserted Islamic power in Spain in a way that it hasn't been felt since the 15th century. For once, a Western power knuckled under to Islamic force, not the reverse. Realities don't matter in the Islamic Middle East; in that world, perception rules. George Bush could say or do nothing that would send Islamist hotheads running to Osama faster than voters in Spain did.         ",5875,1000,You think it's ugly now just wait Tom Ridge says al Qaida may be entering the operational or planning phase of an attack yearning to hit America hard sometime before Election Day Since Sept only the most paranoid fringe players have asserted the cynical theory that the Bush Administration knew what was going to happen that day and let it happen for the sake of some agenda Rather Bush has been condemned for his clueless slack-jawed response Next time if it comes it will be different If I'm right the anti-war voices already are staking out their positions on the grassy knoll ready to open fire with the lurid assertion that Bush knew The virulently anti-war anti-Bush Guardian newspaper in Britain runs an occasional series under the heading Fortress America Today's is titled George Bush's re-election hopes may well hang on al-Qaida's ruthless ingenuity The Guardian doesn't have the guts to come right out and say it But the piece seems aimed at setting up a public suspicion that Bush knows an al Qaida attack gods forbid there should be one between now and November would assure his re-election and that if he has some inclination that one is coming he might not try very hard to stop it Here's the article's conclusion In a recent opinion poll for the Economist handling the war on terror was one of the few areas in which American voters favoured Bush over Kerry It seems likely there would be a wave of patriotic solidarity with the incumbent In short Bush's election chances may depend on the ruthless ingenuity of al-Qaida while Kerry's election chances may depend on the ability of Bush's department of homeland security to combat it There's a paternalism in the institution of the presidency and Americans will rally around an incumbent leader even an unpopular one in a national crisis But the anti-war left has noticed that this can be thwarted quickly and effectively by deflecting the galvanizing effect of an attack into national anger at the administration And their model is Spain A major terrorist attack on the American homeland a few days before November would almost certainly not have the effect that the Madrid pre-election bombing had sending swing voters to the anti-war opposition the Guardian writes No an attack by itself wouldn't But a scandalous revelation that the Bush administration had let it happen surely would and the Guardian surely knows this As do others in its camp It needn't be a full revelation in a nation as split and jittery as we are this year a strong suspicion shouted loudly enough by reputable sources might suffice In Spain voters tossed the U.S.-allied Aznar government just days after a major terrorist attack Nobody accused Aznar of complicity in the attack But they say he knew that if voters connected the deaths to his unpopular decision to take part in the war to overthrow Saddam they would swing behind his opponent Aznar the pundits say too quickly blamed the terror bombings on Basque groups Al Qaida turned out to be the culprit The national anguish at the vicious murder of almost citizens galvanized into anger not at the killers but at the government that named the wrong suspect The U.S is not Spain it's hard to imagine that sequence happening here But you can't blame the Bush-bashers for dreaming of the anger of U.S voters if Bush or his cabinet were believed to have cynically allowed Americans to die for the sake of an election And you have to think some people in high places are already rehearsing what they might say in the days between a terrorist attack on the U.S and the next presidential election As despicable as that would be the Guardian piece veers right off the track into tin-foil-hat territory by suggesting that Bush's self-interest converges with bin Laden's Osama bin Laden must be backing an election victory for George Bush The object of the terrorist is often to reveal the true repressive character of the state against which the terror is directed and thus win further support for the terrorists cause If the United States had just acted in Afghanistan and then concentrated on hoovering-up the remains of al-Qaida the United States might clearly be winning the war on terror today But as bin Laden must have hoped the Bush administration overreacted and thus provided in Iraq and Guantánamo recruiting sergeants for al-Qaida of which Osama could only dream So in this looking-glass world of backhanded ironies al-Qaida terrorists will be backing Bush because he's their best recruiter And in that view the article reports the terrorists may well try to influence the American election by timing an attack to boost Bush into another four-year term OK overlook the howler about putting Afghanistan in one category and Guantanamo in another the Guardian which editorializes tirelessly against Guantanamo doesn't seem to realize that the vast majority of the detainees there were scooped up in the Afghan campaign The fact is the Islamists don't need Bush's policies to bring in recruits They have allies in mosques all around the world tirelessly preaching Jihad and filling the heads of uninformed young men with the most ludicrous lies about the U.S the Jews you name it If the U.S had stopped with Afghanistan the only difference would be that the outcry from the mosques and al Jazeera about human rights abuses secret Mossad operations and mass rapes of Muslim women by G.I.s would have been told about that country rather than Iraq The Guardian doesn't document its suggestion that the more America fights back the more Muslims join the radicals Perhaps in some cases that is so But there is good anecdotal evidence from Iraq that our determined resistance to Islamist jihad dampens the enthusiasm of the enemy not all of them seem to want those virgins right now And a perception of our weakness as in Fallujah is regarded throughout the region as a wonderful gift,60,test
587,587,2922061,1,44,"       A 'liberal' is someone who believes that change can be good, especially when it is guided by a spirit of free inquiry and it aims to increase human freedom and give people more opportunities to guide their own lives. A liberal believes people are basically good, and they can, and want to, make their lives better. It's a faith enshrined in Bobby Kennedy's quote (nicked from G.B. Shaw) about 'seeing things that never were' and saying 'why not?'  A 'liberal' is someone who believes the Enlightenment values enshrined in the constitutions of the Western democracies are true human values, not merely cultural artifacts. That these nations are worthy not because they have some gift from god, not because their citizens are better than those of other lands, but because they have set up these principles as their collective guide and they have committed themselves to live by them, when right, and be corrected by them, when wrong.  I grew up thinking that, and I identified myself as a liberal. What I saw as the opposition was ... well, everything opposite to this. It was many things: Hidebound religious orthodoxy, knee-jerk refusal to think and apply one's mind to political problems, insistence that any change was only going to make things worse. These often could be grouped under the label 'conservative.'  At that time, during the Cold War, 'left' and 'right' generally were seen in terms of 'communist' and 'anti-communist.' But this was a false dichotomy and I got an early education in that.  Twice, in the late 1970s, when I was a teen-ager, I lived in West Berlin and spent some time across the wall in East Germany. It was the most 'conservative' place I have ever been. Nothing changed. Ever. No one experimented. It lacked color, even on a sunny day; no discos, no pool halls. The neon decadence of the Ku-damm in West Berlin might have been on another planet, not just across the wall. With other students, I took a tour of some of the historic sites in the East -- Potsdam, Frederick the Great's palaces, etc. Our tour guide was an employee of the state. No doubt she was chosen particularly to lead this cluster of young Americans. Perhaps they thought they had picked someone to convince us of the virtues of the People's Republic.  A few of us, including our American teacher guide, spent a lot of time up at the front of the bus between stops, chatting with her. She was a matronly woman, good-natured and honest. We probed her about life in the DDR. She said she would never want to live anywhere else. It suited her just fine. In upholding the virtues of her system, she said something I'll always remember: 'when my children go out of the house, I don't have to worry about where they are.'  At one of the palaces on this tour, we happened to pass a line of Hungarian students of about our own age (guided by their own government-supplied minder). They practically broke through the velvet ropes to get to us and pepper us with questions about life in America. They scrawled down addresses and pressed them on us. By the time our respective guides had herded us all on, we on the U.S. side got a clear impression of their restlessness and their hunger for a way of life we took for granted.  This was odd because, back in the U.S., all the anti-com-ya-nists I knew were grumps and blue-hairs who saw the Beatles and blue jeans as evidences of socialist corruption, and all the self-professed communists were layabout bohemians with 'Che' buttons on their ratty army surplus jackets. It was easy to see which of them would have found life better in the Worker's Paradise.  So 'communist' and 'anti-communist' wasn't what I felt. Just like the late '60s false dichotomy of hippies and construction workers. It was an accidental identification. If you want to meet a conservative war supporter today, go to a college campus. If you want to meet a hairy, dope-smoking hedonist, go to a construction site.  But I didn't see at the time how much of the 'liberal' view was simply an anti-American one. Many of the people advocating it didn't really care about Marxism-Leninism, except insofar as the idea of their advocating it pissed off their parents. Many of them also didn't really care about North Vietnamese or South Africans, except insofar as those people were shaking their fists at the company daddy runs.  In Europe, I also met Kurds. I met them in taverns and hostels in Nuremburg, because, for some reason, the small town of Fürth, near there, was a center for black market passports. They were refugees who had escaped ahead of Saddam's death squads after the U.S. had pulled its support from them. This was the moment Iraq shifted from Soviet satellite to U.S. client in containing the Ayatollah. These Kurds weren't bitter. They understood war and politics and betrayal. They wanted to come to the U.S., too, to bide their time and live the life.  When I read about Kurdistan today, I wonder if any of the young men I met in Nuremburg in 1979 survived and are now among the leaders of that reborn land. I was on their side instinctively in 1979; I'm on their side now. An indigenous non-Christian tribal people, victims of decades of official repression, fascist attempts to eradicate their culture and literally wipe them off the face of the earth. Brutally murdered with the complicity -- at least -- of the U.S. government. This ought to be a no-brainer for a true 'liberal.'  But instead the liberals I know have no interest at all in the Kurds, because the Kurds made the unforgivable mistake of liberating themselves with the help of American military power. That makes them the bad guys, because the only indigenous people a modern liberal approves are those that burn American flags.  It's been a year and a half since Ron Rosenbaum's brilliant farewell to 'Left Idiocies,' but I feel more strongly than ever my identification with his kiss-off:    Goodbye to a culture of blindness that tolerates, as part of 'peace marches,' women wearing suicide-bomber belts as bikinis. (See the accompanying photo of the 'peace' march in Madrid. 'Peace' somehow doesn’t exclude blowing up Jewish children.)  Goodbye to the brilliant thinkers of the Left who believe it’s the very height of wit to make fun of George W. Bush’s intelligence—thereby establishing, of course, how very, very smart they are. Mr. Bush may not be the sharpest knife in the drawer (I think he’s more ill-informed and lazy than dumb). But they are guilty of a historical stupidity on a far greater scale, in their blind spot about Marxist genocides. It’s a failure of self-knowledge and intellectual responsibility that far outweighs Bush’s, because they’re supposed to be so very smart.  Goodbye to paralysis by moral equivalence: Remind me again, was it John Ashcroft or Fidel Castro who put H.I.V. sufferers in concentration camps?  Goodbye to the deluded and pathetic sophistry of postmodernists of the Left, who believe their unreadable, jargon-clotted theory-sophistry somehow helps liberate the wretched of the earth. If they really believe in serving the cause of liberation, why don’t they quit their evil-capitalist-subsidized jobs and go teach literacy in a Third World starved for the insights of Foucault?  Goodbye to people who have demonstrated that what terror means to them is the terror of ever having to admit they were wrong, the terror of allowing the hideous facts of history to impinge upon their insulated ideology.   Goodbye to all those who have evidently adopted as their own, a version of the simpering motto of the movie Love Story. Remember 'Love means never having to say you’re sorry'?

597,597,2922061,1,44,"       My timeline here might not be perfect, but I think this is essentially correct. It all started (as far as I can tell) with Peggy Noonan of the  Wall Street Journal  fretting over Bush's prospects in November and, like Alexander Fleming in the penicillin story, accidently discovering  urlLink  a useful fungus   -- useful, in this case, for the Kerry-Edwards ticket:   History has been too dramatic the past 3 1/2 years. It has been too exciting. Economic recession, 9/11, war, Afghanistan, Iraq, fighting with Europe. fighting with the U.N., boys going off to fight, Pat Tillman, beheadings. It has been so exciting. And my general sense of Americans is that we like things to be boring. Or rather we like history to be boring; we like our lives to be exciting. We like history to be like something Calvin Coolidge dreamed: dull, dull. dull. And then we complain about the dullness, and invent excitements that are the kind we really like: moon shots, spaceships, curing diseases. Big tax cuts that encourage big growth that creates lots of jobs for young people just out of school.  No, I am not suggesting all our recent excitement is Mr. Bush's fault. History handed him what it handed him. And no, I am not saying the decisions he took were wrong or right or some degree of either. I'm saying it's all for whatever reasons been more dramatic than Americans in general like history to be.  Here is my fear: that the American people, liking and respecting President Bush, and knowing he's a straight shooter with guts, will still feel a great temptation to turn to the boring and disingenuous John Kerry. He'll never do anything exciting. He doesn't have the guts to be exciting. And as he doesn't stand for anything, he won't have to take hard stands. He'll do things like go to France and talk French and they'll love it. He'll say he's the man who accompanied Teresa Heinz to Paris, only this time he'll say it in French and perfectly accented and they'll all go 'ooh la la!'  The American people may come to feel that George W. Bush did the job history sent him to do. He handled 9/11, turned the economy around, went into Afghanistan, captured and removed Saddam Hussein. And now let's hire someone who'll just by his presence function as an emollient. A big greasy one but an emollient nonetheless.  I just have a feeling this sort of thing may have some impact this year. 'A return to normalcy,' with Mr. Kerry as the normal guy.    This is why blogs are better than big media. Noonan's tranchant observation meant nothing to other newspapers or to TV networks (who tend to studiedly ignore one another). But this piece led to Mickey Kaus, of Slate, who has said some of the shrewdest things about Kerry, coming out and  urlLink  admitting he's decided to vote for him.     I plan to vote for him because I think a) we need a break* from Bush's strident public global terror war in order to prevent it from becoming a damaging, lifelong West vs. Islam clash--in order to 'rebrand' America and digest the hard-won gains we've made in Iraq and Afghanistan (if they even remain gains by next January). Plus, b) it would be nice to make some progress on national health care, even if it's only dialectical 'try a solution and find out it doesn't work' progress. I could change my mind--if, for example, I thought Kerry would actually sell out an incipient Iraqi democracy in a fit of 'realistic' Scowcroftian stability-seeking ....   Along the way, he also coined the perfect Kerry slogan:  'We survived Carter and we'd survive Kerry.'    So Mark Steyn comes back with a piece that rallies people to the big picture:   So we're living through a period of extraordinarily rapid demographic and cultural change that broadly favors the Islamists' stated objectives, a period of rapid technological advance that greatly facilitates the Islamists' objectives, and a period of rapid nuclear dissemination that will add serious heft to the realization of their objectives. If the West – and I use the term in the widest sense to mean not just swaggering Texas cowboys but sensitive left-wing feminists in favor of gay marriage – is to survive, it will only be after a long struggle lasting many decades.   Now go back to watching Fahrenheit 9/11 and kid yourself that this will all go away if Bush, Cheney, and Rummy are thrown out this November.   But Jacob at  urlLink  The Volkh Conspiracy   also makes his case for voting for Kerry without at all rejecting what Bush has accomplished in the world.   It takes a different set of skills and virtues to break something than to build something. The war-on-terror argument for the war in Iraq was that the status quo in the Middle East needed to be broken. The Afghan state that was hopelessly entangled with al Qaeda had earlier needed to be broken. It might be that a Democratic President 2000-04 would not have done either. But reconstruction of both Iraq and Afghanistan is also crucial-- crucial for, as Paul Wolfowitz and others always said, beginning any kind of political-cultural shift that weakens Islamism and moves the Muslim and Arab worlds toward civil society and democracy. And the Bush Administration has not shown any ability to manage those reconstructions successfully. This is not a call to hide from the war on terror for four years and hope it goes away. It's a call to understand that overthrowing states is not the crucial skill oif the current phase of the war on terror; and that that's the only skill the Bush Administration has convincingly shown that it has.   To which  urlLink  Glenn Reynolds   notes:   I don't agree that the reconstruction of Iraq has been a failure -- but even if you buy this argument, the missing part of Levy's position, and Kaus's, is an affirmative demonstration that a Kerry administration would do the job better.Where's the evidence for that?   While Sullivan weighs in with:   This is my defense, I guess. I am passionately in favor of an aggressive war against the Islamo-fascists, but I'm open to debate about tactics and strategy. I certainly don't believe that a pro-war position means some kind of blind fealty to Bush-Cheney. And, of course, as a small government, balanced-budget, libertarian homo, Bush Republicanism is anathema in so many ways. But every time I listen to Kerry, I cannot help but feel that he is hopelessly out of touch with the threats we face and might make our budget problems worse with his healthcare proposal. So I am stuck between a president whose party now officially wants to purge itself of gays and a senator I cannot trust to fight the war we need. These are painful times indeed.    Participatory democracy in action. Watching real people think it through and make their choices in a tough election year. While, come October, our newspaper will run one editorial, saying, in effect, 'vote for Kerry because we say so,' and the other one will run one editorial saying 'vote for Bush because we say so.'
