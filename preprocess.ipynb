         "              I Can See Clearly Now  I went to a psychic today.  She was recommended to me an amazing new force in my life.  I knew I wanted to talk to someone about all the weirdness going on in my life, all of the strange coincidences and quirky manifestations that have been taking place recently.  I wanted to get a different perspective, a higher perspective.  I wanted to make sense of all the little patterns in the ground and find out if they were all part of  urlLink something larger .  I went to the right place.  Her studio in the West 30s was calm and white, with Chinese temple incense burning.  We sat facing each other in folding chairs by a huge window.  She turned on the tape recorder, so I could listen to it all later, started with a prayer and began:  'You are a soul of great power.  That is without question.  The question is how do you choose to use your power?'  What a way to start the session!  Wow.  That was worth the money right there.  She went on to discuss that the choice of using my power referred not only to myself, both inward and outward, but also to my interaction with and bearing on the world.  The image was given to me of a tree.  I was encouraged to think of myself as a powerful, old oak tree.  It's strength doesn't come from it's outward activities, but from it's stillness and longevity.  A tree doesn't need to demonstrate its strength it just  is .  And the longer it  is , the stronger and deeper its roots grow.  She was being guided to show me this as a symbol of the ancient energies which comprise who I am now, to give me that image to focus on, to center myself.  Also, she described a recent wanderlust, a feeling that I needed to move somewhere to regain my strength, and thus the image of this tree, growing strong exactly where it is.    She talked about all the lives I've lived in just these 38 years.  Interesting, since I know I've struggled, but not comparatively.  But then she started to talk about other lives, past ones, and that fascinated me.  She again described my soul as 'ancient.'  She spoke of several lives in Africa, one in particular where I was a healer.  In that life I used magic and bones to bring about the healing that I did.  The bones were ornamental but also spiritual.   'Don't be surprised if, in this life, you become attracted to bones, and collect them in your house.'   Well, my friends, I do love the bones.  I've had over the years a couple of silver skull earrings (one had a moveable jaw which I adored) and, just this past New Year's Eve, I bought a silver necklace of small skulls to wear for the changing of the year.  I also have a few other skull/boney things in my house.  This lady's good.  She also told me that I'd had lives on the water and by the water, working on ships, and one particular life in Hawaii.  A spiritual connection to the ocean and the islands.  I've never been to Hawaii (I'm waiting for  urlLink someone  to take me), but being on or near the ocean has always been really nourishing to me.  Growing up near the Gulf of Mexico, that calm, flat water didn't really interest me.  But when I finally saw the wild ocean...I could've stared at it for days.  And when I've worked on ships, especially crossing the Atlantic, I'd always be drawn out to the decks at night, always with an old, familiar feeling of calmness near, yet enormous respect for, the vastness of the ocean.  Maybe this is true for everyone, but whenever I'm troubled, I always take a long walk by whatever body of water is closest and work things out.  Now that I think of it, my bike rides of late are never in the park are they?  The park's just a couple of blocks away.  Nope, I need to ride by the river.  'So you have in past life, more than once, been in a position of authority, been in a leadership role, been a king.  And the feeling here is...so you're in this incarnation now and something in you has great expectations, 'cause you've done great things before, and when those expectations aren't met quickly, part of you gets disappointed quickly, you're expectations are dashed, and then your emotions may sink or dive.'  Gosh, don't we all wanna hear this?  I always felt I was Anne of Cleves.  But seriously, folks...  It makes sense to me.  I almost always end up in charge.  I almost always make the decisions.  And I almost always grow impatient when the results don't match my expectations.  Then again, maybe she was calling me a control queen.  Hey, stop laughing or I'll send you to  urlLink The Tower .   She talked of one more past life, a life in the desert, where I and two others 'got rid of' someone.  I walked away from it clean and, in fact, prospered as a merchant in that lifetime.  However I carried that with me throughout that life and have some of it with me in this life.  The lesson, it seems, is that when these ethical/moral questions come up in this life, I really only need to come clean to myself.  I don't need to broadcast or discuss it, as long as I'm honest with myself.  Then I can move on and be free.  All I can tell you is that it makes sense to me.  The smallest example of this is, if I go into a store and browse but don't buy anything, I always think I'm going to be accused of shoplifting.  Odd, huh?  Does anybody else every have that feeling?  Anyway, that echoes throughout my life and it's interesting to have it brought up to me in this way.  We then began to focus on now:  'The summer's pretty hectic, it's pretty whacky.  There's a lot of, umm, energy that's kind of churning, and moving, and changing.  September.  We come to September, and here we find some solidity and, um, a real positive vibration.  I find you standing in September and some, actually a good bit of the static and just sort of chaotic energy that surrounds you has settled down.'  Hallelujah, Sister!  Also in September, my focus on basic, day-to-day activity begins to really pay off.  I'm assuming that means attending to the details of daily life and trusting in that simplicity, rather than being overwhelmed by it and doing nothing.  She felt that these daily mundane tasks would also help make me stronger physically.  Again, makes sense to me.  December, she told me, will be blue skies and smooth sailing.  Perhaps literally.  Also she saw me engaged in the thing that I want to be doing, a great feeling of 'flow.'  Beyond that, she saw me, in 2002, engaged in very intense periods of work, followed by a passage of time where there was a lapse between projects, where things are calm.  Sounds like an acting career, no?  The work that she sees coming will be based on my growing knowledge of myself, as determined by myself, rather than my previous identity that I allowed to be defined by others.  She saw me connected with California (can anyone say Blogstalker!  The Series?), and also connections travelling across the country before reaching California, perhaps around Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada.   'There're some people in there that you connect with...that proves significant for you.'    A lot of this reading kept coming back to centering and grounding myself, and how everything good for me would flow from that.  To be almost stubbornly centered.  And that the karma for money to flow into my life, a great deal of money, was in place, but that (a) I need to persevere and (b) that the source of all that money would be unexpected.  Sounds promising.  A very surprising thing she told me was that I should give myself time, even though I feel that I don't have enough time -- that's a myth I've created for myself.  All the areas I want to branch out into, all the things I want to accomplish, might take time, but I have plenty of it.  It's not that I feel old at 38, but I do feel that I've wasted so much time and how much longer will I actually have to get done what I want to get done.  Time is on my side and I shouldn't be in a hurry.  Remember that the next time I'm late to meet you...  Sitting opposite me, with her eyes closed, and with a very palpable energy flowing between us, she know lifts up one hand and moves the other over the flattened palm, miming writing:  There might be some writing....I'm impressed with some creative activity, and some of it is, like, fledgling work.  And just give it time, give it time, let it grow.  It will.'  'I feel something really interesting is gonna happen to you this summer.  But it really has to do with your relationship to yourself.  It's very interesting, it has to do with umm, kind of a shadow falling away.  I feel it has to do with you overcoming a fear.  Letting go of some part of your past.  And I feel it's gonna happen through the people that walk into your life...it's kind of a wake up!'    Guess that would be you, kids.  At this point, she opened the session up and I asked about my money issues.  I said that, oddly enough, I could manifest other things in my life, but the money thing had become more and more illusive and frustrating.  She asked if I felt that I was really manifesting the 'other' stuff, and I said I did.  'Well,' she said, 'you're the magician, so you're creating both.  Let me ask you, what kind of attitude did you grow up with surrounding money.'  And, of course, I saw it.  Or heard, it really.  My mother's voice:  'You're no good at handling money and that's why you'll never have any.'  I mean, jeez...how had I forgotten  that ?   'That history is really catching up to you, you need to release that.  You need to go to the library and get a book on banishing rituals and really do a ritual in your apartment.  Banish the whole poverty mentality.  And you can do it, you've done it in other lives, you can do it in this one.'  While I'm sure there's a lot of eyerolling in Blogdom right now, this actually felt/feels very, very right to me.  I don't think I'm gonna light a candle, clap my hands and wake up on a big pile of money.  But I think it'll definitely signal to myself and the Universe that I'm done with those voices, I'm done being poor, and serve as a reminder to retrain my thinking.  She referred me to  urlLink Barbara Biziou , the ritual guru, who lives in New York.  But whether I go to the guru or just get her book and do it myself, this is something that makes a lot of sense to me.  After all, my  urlLink pool dream  changed my perspective, why shouldn't this?   We talked about more practical ways to manifest this as well, by not engaging in a poverty mentality.  Everyone talks about how broke they are, etc.  She suggested that I don't talk about money at all for awhile, with anyone, and I'm going to work at that.  Also I'm to visualize myself with lots of money, taking care of my needs, having fun with it, taking care of friends...drawing in a prosperous mentality.  I'll let you know what happens.  Maybe I'll buy you something pretty...  We talked about a few other things, my career, my relationships, but it all really came back to getting this poverty mentality out of my head.  The paths would begin to clear to everything else.  I could run into someone on the street who invites me to grab a bite with them.  Today I probably wouldn't go...no cash.  But if I get rid of that condition, I might say yes to dinner and who knows where that path would lead?  While I write this, I realize that the concrete issue of the poverty mentality has bled into all the crevices of my life, creating poverty of creativity, of spirit.  I have some steps I can take that make sense to me now, a way to begin to clear that debris from my path.  Maybe it seems simplistic for you, but to those of us who overcomplicate their worlds, it's a blessing.  I felt my energy change in that room.  She remarked on it, too.  I feel clearer on some things, and hopeful about all of it and I can't wait to get started.  Now things are gonna get  really  interesting...         ",

         "              Boozy Ol' Showgirl  My Gawd,  dahlings , what a weekend.  Shows and booze, booze and shows.  But no boys.  On Friday night, I embarked on an East Village pub crawl with  urlLink Michael , a fellow blogger, and his sexy friend Rick (not Nick, who's apparently someone else).  We had a quick drink at Rick's East Village pad where we tried to sort out the weather patterns of Auckland (to no avail), then headed out to WonderBar.  It was far too crowded and full of undesirables, so we decided to try Starlight.  Also, too crowded.  We ended up settling at the Phoenix.  I like the Phoenix.  It's low maintenance and there's a good jukebox.  Michael was beginning to fade and I had promised to meet JSquared at The Cock, so I bid Michael and Rick goodbye.  The Cock was fairly crowded and JSquared was already at work on his Mandarin and 7-Up (the 21st Century's replacement for a Sloe Gin Fizz, in my opinion).  I was at work on my third Citron & Tonic.  We chatted with friends, browsed the lounge in the back, downed another drink or two, and headed home.  Saturday afternoon, I was invited to the matinee of ' urlLink Bells Are Ringing ' before its closing on Sunday.  I'm so glad I did.  Faith Prince is just a Big Broadway Star.  There's no one like her.  She's fun, funny, quirky and she can break your heart with one bat of those luscious lashes.  I've always been in love with her.  After her big  urlLink Eleven O'clock Number  'I'm Goin' Back' the applause was so extended and exhuberant that they couldn't get the show restarted for about 10 minutes.  Faith was so moved.  I was sitting close enough to see her on the verge of tears, it's been such an emotional journey for her, and a few minutes into this ovation, Beth Fowler, who was standing behind Faith onstage, stepped a little closer to her and put her hand on the small of Faith's back to steady her.  'Bells' is a terrific show and, even with its problems, deserved a longer, happier run than this.  But I was glad I got to see it.  I sat with JP and his mother and step-father and, at intermission, while we were stretching our legs, I spotted my stalker sitting a few rows behind us, all the way house left.  Yes, the Blogstalker has a stalker of his own.  Well, had.  Has.  Whatever.  I haven't talked about him much, nor will I now, but it's always disconcerting to see him (though he no longer approaches me, having learned the hard way what a bad idea that really is).  Saturday night, my old friend from LA (Peter and I shared him in the divorce), Rupert (a noted television writer), wanted to see our newest watering hole,  urlLink XL .  I'm not a huge fan of Chelsea bars anymore, but I still adore Chelsea alcohol.  And there is something kinda  urlLink Logan's Run  about XL (even if I end up feeling like  urlLink Peter Ustinov  rather than  urlLink  Michael York).  At any rate, I let Rupert take in the ever-changing wall colors, the toothsome (if hairless) bartenders, and even the fish in the bathroom.  But after a couple of drinks we longed for the sight of real men and decided to wend our way to, yes, the East Village.  Rupert, being an Angelino, insisted we hop in a cab, so we ended up at the Boiler Room a little too early.  The good news was there was a clear path to the bar.  My favorite bartender, a long-haired biker daddy wasn't working, but I drank just the same.  Rupert had a hankering to visit a skanky bar we'd been to a few years ago that I was positive had closed but for which he'd seen a recent advertisement, a placed called I.C.Guys.  I remember it being about as big as my bathroom, where they served only beer in cans and every few minutes a barely-legal wisp of a boy would hop on a crate in baggy  urlLink Underoos  and do a desultory little dance.  Not of it appealed (especially the no-vodka policy) but one must occasionally cater to one's out-of-town guests.  Mercifully, I.C.Guys is C.L.Osed, so we continued on to WonderBar.  This time it wasn't too packed, the music was good, and so we stayed for a drink.  Well, actually I drank, Rupert was switching to bottled water, which concerned me mightily, as you might imagine.  It seems Rupert had accidentally ingested some sort of happiness-inducing tablet (I forget what he called  urlLink it ).  It made me wanna drink more.  So I did.  Off, off, off we were to our next stop, Starlight, a mellower, loungy lounge.  I ran into a group of friends, including Alberto and his boyfriend Mark.  We chatted, I drank, and Rupert began to kick in.  I have to say, I was a little jealous.  Jealousy, of course, makes me thirsty.    Now, Rupert, having grown up in Indiana and now living in Los Angeles, has a fascination for Brooklyn boys.  Dark haired, beefy, Brooklyn-accent and, preferably chewing gum with his mouth open.  He found one in Starlight, but soon found him dull and requested that we press on.  I said goodnight to my friends and wove our way to the Phoenix.  Have I mentioned I like the Phoenix?  Well, I do.  The bartender tonight was a former co-worker of a bartender that I dated for awhile when they both were slinging gin over to the Barracuda, so we got our first round free.  Yes, he gave us two Citron & Tonics.  What's that you say?  You're absolutely right, Rupert  is  only drinking water.  Well, I guess I'll just down these myself.  There was lots to look at in this bar.  One very cute boy who kept walking slowly by us was especially cute and, I thought, interested in Rupert.  But the minute Rup went downstairs to the bathroom, the boy came over and introduced himself to me.  Adrian.  Yo.  Shorter than me, pretty dark bluish-green eyes, nice hair, tight body, but I could tell it was doomed from the start.  Adrian is a musician, writes, sings, plays.  But not in front of people, not yet.  Instead he runs a hair salon.  Why, I ask, are gay men so predictable?  Adrian, as it turns out, is also 24.  Run Logan5...the Old Man will only try to drag you to the City of Domes!  We chatted for a bit and, to his credit, didn't just give the standard, 'I've gotta run to the bathroom' line, but instead stuck out his hand and said it was nice to meet me.  Why, I ask, are gay men so unpredictable?  Rupert meanwhile, was sniffing around another gum-chewer, until he heard him talk and the decision was quickly made to change venues.  So then, to The Cock.  Why, I ask, am I so predictable?  The Cock was hopping (that sounds dirty, doesn't it?).  Great music, as usual, boys we knew and boys we didn't, and, mostly importantly to me tonight, vodka.  Freshly armed, we strolled about, listening in on conversations, catching up on each others lives (our variously abused substances making us rather chatty).  Rupert decided to do a Love Lap on his own, so I gave him space by making one in the opposite direction.  There in the back lounge were Alberto and Mark.  After a bit (and another vodka) I decided I should probably check on my little tripping pal (and maybe pee), so I excused myself and went to do a little search of the bar.  I think this is where I noticed that someone had replaced my shoes with some sort of footwear made entirely of  urlLink Weebles .  Mercifully, Weebles wobble, but the don't fall down.  I after successfully navigating the treachorously flat floor, I found Rup sitting on the dark banquette engaged in some sort of gum-chewing exchange.  Knowing that he was in good, umm, hands, I peed and returned to Alberto and Mark.  But only Alberto was left.  'Where's Mark?'  'Oh, he's out there,' Alberto said with a casually wave of the back of his hand towards an ever-growing cluster of young men in the middle of the back lounge.  'I think he's sucking face with some Asian guy he met earlier.'  Oh.  Well.  As I leaned against the wall taking in that information, even more information came to me.  'You know I've always thought you were really sexy,' Alberto confessed.  I tried to come up with some sort of response but couldn't make my tongue work.  No...wait...that's not  my  tongue, that's  Alberto's  tongue.  My poor vodka-logged thought processors were trying to match this up to reality, but were slow to react, making me seem complicit.  It's not that Alberto's not adorable, he certainly is.  But he's not  my  type of adorable.  Plus, he's got a boyfriend and I don't picnic in that park anymore.  I extricated myself, I hope gracefully (I guess I'll find out by the reception I get at the gym next time I see them).  About this time, Rupert ambled up with his latest gum-chewer, a nice boy from Chile.  'I have to be up early for my flight, so I'm going back to my hotel.'  'Umm, Ruppie, you're not staying in a hotel.'  'I am now,' he said impishly, giving me a peck on the cheek and a warm hug.  'I'll call you from L.A.' and off he went to improve our relations with South America.  It was my cue to go as well.  I was now faaaaar past the drinky-winky point that any sane 38-year-old should reach.  All I wanted was a fast taxi, a cool bedroom and a warm puppy.  Easier said than done.  There were no cabs for me.  I walked from Avenue A and 13th Street to Sixth Avenue and 25th Street before I found a cab.  Along the way I did manage to find two McRib Jr. sandwiches, a Diet Coke, and some sort of Sour Apple Twizzler-esque candy.  Don't ask (wouldn't do you any good anyway).  I made it home, took the Dex outside, fell into bed and slept the sleep of the tragically vodkaed.  Sunday?  The final performance of  urlLink A Class Act .  My pal Patrick got me tickets to see the final performance of this quirky show (I had also seen the gypsy run-through).  It was, for so many reasons, a really touching performance.  This cast has stuck together through a lot of crap and really made this material personal and interesting and touching.  Lonny Price, the writer, director, and start, actually checked himself out of the hospital to perform these songs for the last time.  Backstage was packed after, and as usual, I was asked what I was up to; what was I in.  Trouble, I answered blithely and moved on.  I'm so glad I didn't miss this last performance, even if I had to sit in the middle of a pack of poorly-dressed, ill-informed, unmannered yahoos from the provinces who apparently believe that the theatre is the perfect place to prop your feet up on the back of the chair in front of you, chat it up, and eat sunflower seeds (depositing the husks on the floor).  Why, I ask you, are yahoos so predictable?  All in all, not a bad weekend.  I successfully managed to avoid a hangover, meaningless sex, ruining any friendships, damaging insights, most of the Puerto Rican parade, meaningless crying jags, being hacked to death by my stalker, indigestion, answering direct questions about my career, breaking up any relationships, and Valium.  Who could ask for anything more?         ",

         "              The Long Goodbye  Over the weekend I managed to get rid of a lot of stuff.  Big stuff.  King-sized stuff (well, at least the bed was).  I'm beginning to have a lot of 'last time I'll...' moments, too.  Friday night whilst I was covered in dust and doghair, packing things for  urlLink Sparky's  arrival on Saturday to move things to the Rumpus Room, I got an impromptu call from  urlLink The Minx  to join him in a cocktail.  While I didn't think there was room in such a small glass, I hurriedly cleaned up and walked over to meet him.  We met at the  urlLink much-blogged-about  Barrage, which was packed.  I have to say, I wasn't so much in the mood to be in cramped quarters with a lot of chatty fags, but I didn't think I'd get another chance to say goodbye to Chad.  And I'm glad I did, although I was only good for one drink.  We even got to see an aspiring dj that we'd both dallied with.  But, as I had much to do and Chad's parents were in town, we headed out.  Walking up Ninth Avenue, getting filled in on New Orleans, I looked down a side street and saw an old friend, someone whom I'd actually understudied  urlLink Off-Broadway , and wanted to say goodbye to.  Chad left me there and I snuck up on Ray for a big hug.  I guess this is as good a time as any to mention two things.  First, the Universe or Whomever has been tossing me people and places to say goodbye to, or at least to have one last glimpse of.  Or maybe just to stir a memory.  Either way, a lot of my 18 years is being placed at my feet to either admire or stumble over.  It's fascinating.  Second, I've learned that when you tell boys you're leaving town, you instantly become The Most Desired Guy in Manhattan.  Boys are freaks.  But more on all that later.  Anyway, I got to see Ray and his lover of (get this) 26 years one last time before I go.  They're hilarious.  A very showbusiness couple, in a hilarious way.  I adore them.  We walked a bit, promised to try and have dinner before I leave (which looks unlikely) and promised to keep in touch, etc.  This saying goodbye thing isn't so easy, after all.  I mean, I knew I was really leaving when I tossed away my trove of take-out menus, and that was hard enough.  But saying goodbye to people really drives home the point.  I really don't know when I'll see any of them again.  Some of them perhaps never again.  I won't just stumble across them on Eighth Avenue, they won't be on my block on the way to the Ziegfeld.  And the goodbyes are just gonna get harder.  I tried to pack a little more that night, but, as it was my last night in my glorious king-sized bed, I thought Dex and I should just relax and enjoy it.  I think he might miss it slightly more than I will.  After all, it was the first big thing he ever learned to jump on, because it was the only thing that separated us at night.  And he can have his snugglebunny moment, then retreat to a far corner and snooze.  And when will I have another bed that sleeps a Brazilian soccer team?  Ah, the memories...  Saturday morning I got up and got right to work breaking down the bed.  I moved it into the hallway and suddenly my bedroom was the size of Kansas.  Now, I thought, it's beginning to look like I'm moving out.  Sparky was right on time, bearing coffee and sugary delights (as if he himself weren't sugary delight enough for any man), and we got his stuff down to the street and waited for the man with the van.  More like freak in a zebra-painted truck, but he got the job done (Sparky's a patient, patient man).  So now the Rumpus Room is equipped for the Brazilian soccer team and I, in exchange, have a sleek, new laptop to take with me to NOLA, rather than the sad Etch-A-Sketch I've been using at home.  And, as a bonus, while we were unloading and assembling,  urlLink Ralph  played me some New Orleans-inspired music and answered my inane questions about the place.  Scampering back to Manhattan, a little more packing, then off to dinner at the Polish Tea Room (aka Cafe Edison) with Jon Jordan.  Jon's working on the new Neil Simon show '45 Seconds From Broadway,' which takes place at the Edison, so it was a logical choice.  My last taste of their matzoh ball soup, chopped chicken liver, corned beef on extra soft rye.  Please tell me there are Jews in New Orleans, and at least one of them can cook!  I dropped Jon back off at the theatre, more packing for me, then off to meet  urlLink Mike  and his friend Not Nick at, where else, Barrage.  I got there slightly before they did, and had three 'I can't believe you're leaving me, I have a big crush on you, let's get married' experiences.  I'm sure at least two of them were fueled by Cosmopolitans, but still...it was slightly uncomfortable.  Especially when someone's saying he can't believe you're leaving him, and then making out with an escort on the other side of him who he may or may not have been paying for.  I was told that a screenplay had been written with me in mind and I couldn't leave until it was shot.  That someone else was sure with enough time I'd come around and we'd be together always.  I was never so happy to see Mike and Not Nick!  We sat in a corner and blabbed for awhile, me flirting a little with sexy Not Nick, until the pressure of All Things As Yet Unpacked began to crush my skull and I had to flee.  Michael, we'll continue our conversation over a to-go cup on Bourbon Street...  On the way home I ran into two other people I hadn't see in ages, one I knew and we chatted a minute, the other I've never met but have had a long time crush on.  In fact, his picture was once in a local fag rag and I cut it out and pasted it on my computer.  It's still there.  I thank the Universe for one last glimpse.  Where am I?  Sunday?  Ah, yes, Sunday.  Because I haven't had enough hauling and packing and disassembling and taping, I promised  urlLink Choire  I'd help him with some light chores (for a small fee, naturally).  But first, my ex and his new husband were coming by to pick up my favorite piece of furniture.  I looked long and hard for an old armoire that I could use as an entertainment center and finally found one that I adore.  I couldn't bear to sell it, but it's just to big to put in storage.  Paul and Matthew agreed to buy it, move it and, if I ever move back and still want it, I could buy it back from them.  So I know my baby's being taken care of.  Of course, choosing a Sunday to move furniture turned out not to be so good for renting U-Hauls, so they showed up with a mini-van.  Yes, you're right, mini-van's  do  have seats.  Apparently the fold down, but when they drove away, half of my armoire was sticking out of the back.  He came back a little while later and picked up an old wooden wheelchair from the 30s (don't ask why I have it...I'm kooky, okay?).  Then another, harder goodbye.  Backstory:  The day that Paul and I ran into each other at the theatre, a week after we'd met briefly at a New Year's Eve party, I'd been in such a hurry to get ready that I'd just glooped up my hair with some shiny gel product that smelled of citrus in order to tame my wild head of hair.  Later that evening, when we were making out in my apartment and he'd gotten a generous amount of said gloop on his hands, I felt his hand on my lower back.  'Don't think I don't know you're wiping your hands on my shirt...'  We laughed and it became one of our inside jokes.  Sunday morning:  After getting the wheelchair into the van and giving me a Coach leather collar for Dex (it didn't fit their dog), he looked at his hands and said, 'Ugh, I'm so dusty and I have to go up to a teacher/parent meeting.'  I was already grungy, so I told him to clean them off on my tshirt  'Don't think I don't know you're wiping your hands on my shirt,' he said quietly to me.  It was all I could do to not fall down.  He'd not only remembered that long ago moment, but he was saying goodbye in the only way good ol' not-sentimental, only ever be happy Paul could do it.  I waved, but I had to get inside fast.  Thank you, Pongo.  I managed to pull together my weepy ass and get downtown to meet Choire.  An adventure I'll let him blog about.  But we did have an amazing dinner and then, helpless kitten that he is, he let me talk him into not only getting coffee at the Big Cup, but sitting down to drink it.  He looked like a caged animal in there!  Highly amusing.  We wandered down Eighth Avenue, looking at the gays and their clothing shops, down to 14th Street to look for duffel bags for me, which became a high-pressure sales pitch from a Badu-headress-wearing Dominican saleswoman that I think I want to be when I grow up.  Sadly, after looking at their selection and realizing it would just be one more thing to stow once I get to New Orleans, I left empty handed.  Choire had the brilliant suggestion of just using garbage bags, which I hadn't even considered.  'You haven't been poor long enough,' he told me.  Oh, really?  Sure as hell feels like it.  We got to about Fifth Avenue and I knew I had to go nap and start on the mountain of laundry calling my name on 54th Street.  Is this really where I'm gonna say goodbye to Choire?  Here?  We hugged, said a little goodbye, he rendered me a check for my services (I'll just let you all believe what you want to about that), said some highly unmemorable stuff, and walked away.  But Choire?  Thanks.  Most obviously, thanks for pushing me to blog.  It cracked my world open and let the future in.  But thanks for the hundred small things that I've forgetten to thank you for, or even the ones I already have.  Thanks for not feeding the drama queen.  Thanks for telling other people I'm good.  Thanks for telling me, too.  Thanks for making me go see that movie about Mexican dogs.  Just thanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanksthanks.  We have some weird connection, you and I, but I enjoy the hell out of it.  We really are the most improbable friends.  But from our online chats, to the Flatiron Building, to Ralph's you've helped me to stay afloat these past few months and I hope someday I make myself worthy of your friendship.  I love you.  I've gotta go now...I'll blog more later...         ",

         "              Warning:  Gay Homosexual Showtune-Related Blog Ahead  Number of Hellos/Waves in Line:  6 Number of 'You Look Beautiful/Wild/Sexy' Comments I Got:  5 Number of Times I Actually Believed It:  2 Number of Times I Denied It:  0 I sauntered over to the Tonys last night around 6:50pm.  Since  urlLink Radio City  is just a couple of blocks from my apartment, I decided to forego the limo and walk...just like a regular person.  It was still light out, so I put on some sassy $4-from-the-street shades (the vendor assured me they were  Oakrey ).  Apparently my attempt at tricking the dregs of my closet into thinking it was some sort of formal wear worked.  Maybe it was the glitter in my hair or the (pear-flavored) gloss on my lips.  Whatever.  As I strolled towards Radio City I pretended in my head that I was Jane Russell in 'Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,' and that helped make my stride purposeful but sexy.  It seems that there are two entrances to the Tony Awards:  the 'celebrity' entrance and the 'non-celebrity' entrance.  I thought it might be fun to try the 'non-celebrity' entrance (as it was my only option) and I found it to be deliciously common.  Snaking all the way down 50th Street, I got to pass by everyone already in line, waving and smiling, saying something brief but witty and then walk on.  It was fun.  There were of course a lot of people on the streets and on the other sides of the barracades watching us line up to go in.  Turns out they're  very  interested in guys with glittery hair and unbuttoned pink tuxedo shirts.  Do you ever have those days when everybody on the street thinks they know you from somewhere?  I had one yesterday (thank goddess it wasn't wasted on a laundry day or something).  I waved like I was somebody, they waved back. ( Actually, I waved 'cause I kinda felt sorry for those people...they must've kicked themselves when their friends told them who they saw on 51st Street.)    Once inside I milled around a bit in the lobby, chatted with a high-powered theatrical lawyer who tried to touch me inappropriately and a dessicated diva who seemed heavily medicated, but fun as that was, I quickly made my way to the Grand Staircase.  I love the Grand Staircase at Radio City; it's one of those time portals of Manhattan.  You can just picture  urlLink ladies with hats and gloves , and gentlemen with  urlLink Arrow collars  and  urlLink spectator shoes  on their way in to see 'The Philadelphia Story' for the very first time.  It's impossible not to climb that stair and not feel like part of another era.  The balustrade was lined with people scanning the lobby for famous faces, so I sailed up and found a place at the landing.  Oh look, down there's the editor of that showbiz newspaper.  Hi!  Are you really with  him ?  Do you know he backed me up against a wall at the O'Neill Center and fogged up my glasses?  Have a terrific time!  Jeez, Ann Miller.  That dress sure is  red .  My god, there's the Luckiest Chorus Boy in the World...I've been wondering where he'd disappeared to.  From the looks of it, he got locked in the Sara Lee factory and had to eat his way out.  Oops, better not throw those particular stones considering the number of pants I had to try on before I left the house.  There go the lights, better make my way towards my seat.  But first, I have to collect my Playbill. The Tony Award Playbill is something of a collector's item.  Really, it's the Beanie Baby of show programs.  So in order to get your program, you have to go to one of the designated areas and have your ticket punched and you receive one (1).  I needed my ticket punched, so I grabbed my Playbill and headed throught the mist of air kisses toward my seat.    First mezzanine, House Left, Row B.  From my seat I could see all of the nominees below and most of the celebrity guests.  I was sitting more or less in a direct line behind Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft.  On either side of that massive stage, there are two enormous screens so that one can see what's being broadcast, although they turn them off at some points throughout so audience shots don't show people gawking up at them.  There were a few speeches that weren't shown on the first hour (the PBS broadcast) one of them being, I believe, Paul Gemignani's Lifetime Achievement Award.  The man is genius and, even though he knew he was getting it, he was genuinely moved during his speech, thanking not only all of the pit musicians he's worked with whom he called 'incredibly talented and wholly devoted to the theatre' and also specifically Stephen Sondheim who he said 'taught him to care about music more than he thought possible.'  That whole first hour, with Stro winning and thanking Mike, etc., seemed very 'inside,' but we soon grew tired of the dreaded words: 'The Producers.'  I was afraid we were going to be forced to have the logo tattooed on our asses before being allowed to leave.  Frankly, that show doesn't need any more money or press.  Ditto '42nd Street.'  How 'bout helping out those shows that could use the boost of a Tony win?  Hell, toss 'em lighting design, as long as they can claim '2001 Tony Winner!' in front of the theatre.  But noooooooooo... Number of Actress Performing in Best New Musical category That I Performed with Off Broadway Last Year:  2 Number of Actors Who Are Also Presidents of the Union performing in Best New Musical Category Who Directed Above-Gratuitously-Mentioned Off Broadway Show:  1 Number of 2001 Tony Nominees I've Slept With:  1 Number of 2001 Tony Nominees Whose Boyfriends I've Slept With:  2 Number of People Thanked (in any category) That I've At the Very Least Made Out With:  7 Number of Nominated Playwrights Whose Birthday Parties I Attended on a First Date:  1 Number of Newsanchors I've Slept With That Were Spotted in the Men's Room:  1 Really the best part was celebrating in the success of friends and people I've worked with.  It was exciting to me to have a personal connection to so many people on that stage.  Makes ya feel like it's not such an unattainable thing after all, huh?  Also, commercial breaks were fun with people dashing out of the theatre towards the restrooms or the phones and having impromptu gossip sessions in the lobby.  I used one to reapply my lip gloss (that's when I saw the alleged Newsanchor), and another to call my friends at the party on the Upper West Side, right after Gary Beach's speech mentioning the Upper West Side, to say hey from the glamorous Tonys and that I'd rather be there with the little people, eating salty snax and wearing comfy clothes.  It was almost true, too.  The two numbers that really got the crowd in the auditorium going were 'Let It Go' from 'The Full Mony' and  'Time Warp' from 'Rocky Horror,' especially when Jonathan Sharp jumped into the audience and got Gwynneth Paltrow to dance, James Stovall got Andre de Shields to dance, but no one could get Mel Brooks up (guess we don't support other people's shows).  It was pretty clear that Viola Davis was gonna win Best Featured Actress In A Play after what was basically a tour-de-force (while I am forced to tour) monologue from 'King Hedley' (how great is Stokes that he set that up for her?).  No one was surprised by Cady Huffman's win, and her speech was sweet, but man, wouldn't you've loved to hear Kathleen Freeman's speech?  Or for that matter Polly Bergen's?  And it's always great to see people like Gary Beach, who've been kicking around this town forever, get a little recognition.  Leaving Radio City I ran into my friend Greg on the Grand Stairway (I love saying Grand Stairway) and we milled for a bit in the lobby saying hi to friends and me, of course, saying hi to strangers (maybe it was the eyeliner, who can say?).  We did a little post-mortem as we walked to Studio 54 for the Rocky party and I thought about my first Tony experience.  I learned a few things and, Gentle Readers, I want to share them with you, just in case you're invited next year:  It's glamorous arriving and leaving but, unless you're nominated, it's like going to Radio City to watch TV. Just because your clothes are shiny doesn't mean they're suitable for evening wear. Also, you  can  wear too many tassles. Tan Hush Puppies will never,  ever  go with that tux. When in doubt, smile and, as you glide past, grab their wrist, wrinkle your forehead a little and say ever-so-sincerely in a lowered voice, 'You look ter RIF ic!' Bring snacks. Don't make exasperated noises when someone or something you thought should win didn't.  If you really had any say, you wouldn't be sitting next to me in the First Mezzanine.  Especially in that suit. Do be vocally supportive of your nominated friends.  Apparently they  can  hear it and it makes them smile. Let him cruise you a little, then say hi using his name.  Don't stick around to explain. Don't pretend you're more important that you are. Next year, be more important than you are. At least once during the whole experience, skip almost all the way to the men's room 'cause, dammit, you're at the TONY AWARDS!  The party was a whole 'nother experience, but daddy's a little worn out from floggin' the blog.  Also, I got in around 4am and had to be at The Evil Empire around 9am, so a nappy is in order.  But I promise I'll tell who took their shirts off, which nominated actresses dropped entire trays of sushi on chorus girls, which former Tony winner was drinking splits of champagne with a straw, etc.  I'm gonna go nap with my Tony Playbill under my pillow.  Maybe the Tony Faerie will bring me one of my own...they spin, y'know...         ",

         "              Internal Inventory  I don't really know what to tell you.  I spent the evening last night trying to write letters to sort everything out should anything need to be sorted.  Loose ends need to be tied up as much as possible so that those less capable (read, everyone else) won't bungle it.  Also trying to think of painless ways to do painful things with a minimum of cleanup after.  This is probably why more Virgos don't actually kill themselves.  I have a huge collection of things that I love that will mean almost nothing to anyone else, and yet I care where they end up.  Who even remembers 'My One & Only,' much less cares that I saw it about six times and own the propeller that Tommy Tune carried around in it?  Or Sarah Brightman's double mask from 'Phantom?'  Sheryl Lee Ralph's shoes from 'Dreamgirls' might be an easier sell, but probably not B.D. Wong's shoes from 'M. Butterfly'.  What about the model for the set of Cinderella's house from 'Into The Woods,' the mining pick from 'Crazy For You' signed by the entire original cast, my letter from Sondheim, my letter from Katharine Hepburn?  My collected works of the Algonquin Round Table...most of them first editions, many signed.  That Woollcott biography of Mrs. Fiske is damn rare, and how'm I gonna explain that the Jack Baragwanath (who was Neysa's husband) memoir is personally autographed to Robert Sherwood's wife...ugh.  The disposition of this junk is keeping me from swallowing a handful of...of... what?   ...well, that's a whole 'nother issue.  I refuse to jump from something.  I'm not slitting anything.  I don't own a gun, nor do I know anyone who does.  Oh wait, I do, but I'm not talking to him.  Partly 'cause he owns a gun.  As evidenced by the inventory taken of my medicine cabinet, I haven't got a handful of anything that would induce the Sleep of Ages.  I had two aunts that killed themselves.  One, who had Parkinson's and could barely hold a soupspoon, shot herself.  She didn't have to, but she thought she did.  The other was 98 years old and always said that when she got tired of it all, she'd walk all the way to the end of the pier behind her house and jump in the river.  That's where they found her.  Can't really blame either of them.  But, as I said, the gun thing horrifies me and, while drowning seems somehow more palatable, the East River's filthy and out of the question and the Hudson doesn't look like it would do the job.  I mean, I  can  swim.  So what does it mean?  Does it mean I don't have the courage of my convictions?  Possibly.  Does it mean that I'm a big pussy?  Sure, okay.  Does it mean that I want to live.  I don't know.  No.  Yes.  I don't know.  I had a few dreams last night, as you might imagine.  The one I remember the most took place in my apartment.  It didn't look like the apartment I live in now, but it was meant to be in the dream.  I've dreamt of living in that apartment before and always before there were rooms and areas within the apartment that I'd never come across before that dream.  This was no different.  In this dream I first noticed that my apartment was empty.  Then I noticed that the service entrance (which actually looked like the service entrance in my real apartment) was open and some of my belongings were stacked there.  I panicked and went back inside to see what was missing...nothing seemed to be.  I then wandered into the back service hallway and saw through a hallway that doesn't really exist, some neighbors I'd never seen before.  One looked cute and was wearing briefs.  I thought I'd get a better look if I went to the window in the back bedroom.  I walked through the apartment to a room I had forgotten even existed.  It wasn't really big enough to be a bedroom, but it was slightly elevated and had windows all the way across the back wall.  Then I realized that they weren't just windows, but sliding doors.  How had I never noticed that?  I stepped up into that room, slid the door open and stepped onto a small terrace I also hadn't known was there.  The sun hit this terrace through some trees and it was so warming and pleasant that I stood there for a few minutes soaking up the heat.  Then I looked around.  Apparently in all the time I'd forgotten to check this back room, they'd built a pool.  Full-size, in-ground pool.  And all the apartments on my floor opened onto this pool area, which was white stucco, with pale brick accents.  And flooded with light.  The neighbor I had seen before was swimming in it, and others were gardening on their terraces, etc.  I thought to myself, 'I can't believe I'm leaving here now that there's this beautiful warm terrace and a pool to enjoy, especially just as summer's starting.'  I also remember wondering how long it had been there, and that I could've been enjoying it all this time.  None of my neighbors seemed surprised to see me, although I didn't recognize any of them.  I remember starting down the stairs from my terrace towards the pool to check the water, and then I don't remember anything else.  Closer to dawn, I remember being half awake while this rapid-fire slide show went off in my head.  So fast that not a single image remains.  It was disorienting in it's speed and also in the fact that each image contained some full emotion that hit me fully but moved on with the next image/feeling.  I don't remember any of it specifically, just that it happened.  I couldn't get my ass out of bed this morning.  My angelic puffin (who's real name is Dexter and who said to me in a dream several nights ago that he didn't like the pseudonym 'Rex' because it made him sound common and he didn't need his anonymity protected) stood worried guard over me until I managed to sit up.  We took a short walk, I made us breakfast, I packed some books, I sat on the sofa and cried.  Finally, I made the call I'd been dreading.  I called the landlord to tell him that, even though I'd promised to get him this money by the end of the month, I just didn't have it.  I said I could send him a check for $800 and I'd work on getting him the rest as soon as I could, but I honestly didn't know when or how fast that would be.  Do you know what he said to me?  He said, 'You've sent in money when you told me you would, and I consider you a man of your word.  So I'll work with you on this.'  A man of my word.  Me?  I don't know what to do with this information.  And this from a man who very recently made me feel that my absence would be worth far more than my presence.  Is he fucking with me?  I got email today from a bunch of people, many of them bloggers, almost all of them people I've never met.  They all said different-but-similar things: that I had value.  These are all people I consider to be interesting, accomplished, intelligent...at least in their writing and in the information they've chosen to put out into the world.  Man, I thought to myself, I've pulled some major wool over an internet full of eyes.  I have value?  I don't know what to do with that information, either.  Jesus H., I just got off the phone.  It was JSquared.  Through him, the Universe has decided to pluck me up by the scruff of my neck and toss me into the second weirdest place I could be this weekend:  'I have an extra ticket to the Tonys and the Rocky Horror Tony party after.'  What.  The.  Fuck?  Now 'Happy Couple Party' doesn't sound so bad.  Nooooo, now my option is put on a fake Prada suit that I'll feel fat in and enter the belly of the Showtune Singin' Beast.  I really don't know what to do with this information.  It's not like anyone's gonna say 'what the hell are you doing here?'  I actually think people assume I go to these things all the time.  But what if they ask 'what are you in now?'  Or even, 'how are you?'  I'm petrified of these questions.  Last night I thought I was done.  This morning, too.  I still thought so at the beginning of this entry.  But it looks like, for the moment at least, I have to throw in the towel on throwing in the towel.  I really don't understand it.  I wish I had some sort of perspective or could just get a peek at the schematic.  Something, anything...'cause I just don't understand it.  It's easy to say, 'let go and see where the current takes you,' but it's not such an easy thing to do.  It's not something that makes sense to me.  Faith?  As if.  But given the fact that, strong desire aside, I seem ill-prepared to jump ship at the moment, and the fact that I'm being tossed all manner of weird life preservers, I suppose I might as well just 'ride it out, girlfriend.'  Y'know, I was telling RJ the other night that, no matter how bad the movie or play or book, I always stick it out to the end.  Don't know why.  Maybe it's stubbornness or strong curiosity...and sometimes it's been rewarded.  I guess I should afford my so-called life the same courtesy.         ",

         "          [You say] the UN is a useless club for other countries (dictators?) to lecture the US and accomplish nothing; also, the UN is not the same as the world (from another of your messages): The UN is an assembly of representatives of the world's governments. I may be wrong, but, as a result of the expansion of democracy in the last 2 decades, the UN has now a large majority of democratically elected governments. In this sense, it represents the world's will (in the same way that the US Congress represents the will of the American people).  Now, if this is true, how can one say that its debates are useless? And how can one consign it to oblivion simply because it doesn't happen to assent to one's wishes?    According to Freedom House, 'electoral democracies constitute 120 of the 192 internationally recognized independent polities.' But to say that the U.N. represents 'the world's will' in the way that Congress represents the American people's will is false. The U.S. people directly elect their Congress. A little under two-thirds of the people in the U.N. elect their leaders. Those leaders then  appoint  representatives to the U.N. And the U.N.'s work is often done at the level of committees which are elected from among the representatives. So the relation that the U.N. bears to the people of the world is more like that of a U.S. Senate subcommittee. And those can be pretty far off base.  The UN has noble ideals, but a rotten reality. Consider the outrageous decision, on the eve of the Iraq war, to name a delegate from Libya to head the UN Human Rights Commission (UNHRC). Thirty-three of the UNHRC's 53-member nations voted in favour of Libya and 17 abstained, even though Libya is still under UN sanctions for supporting international terrorism. This is the conscience of the world community? Ghadafi's regime, which the U.N. itself has accused of summary executions and systematic use of torture, should sit in judgment of Denmark and Japan and Singapore?  Instead, the U.N. General Assembly has been obsessed with condemning the Jewish state -- along with Turkey, the sole real democracy, till now, in the entire festering Middle East. Driven by its Arab bloc, supported by Third World dictatorships, and with the increasing support of EU nations currying favor with the Arabs, the U.N. has passed more resolutions condemning Israel than any other nation on Earth, while excusing Palestinian terrorism and ignoring the catastrophic human rights violations of Israel's regional enemies.   The UNHRC especially has a history of singling out Israel and recently all but endorsed terrorism against its civilians through a resolution supporting 'armed struggle ... by all available means.' But it was at the infamous World Conference Against Racism in Durban in 2001 where the years of festering U.N. anti-Semitism flowed out in public in raw displays of anti-Semitism, including intimidation, harassment and hate-filled speeches. The conference was hijacked by those whose only interest was to bash Israel at what was supposed to be a forum against world racism.  Attempts even were made to revive the infamous 'Zionism is racism' resolution passed by the General Assembly in 1975 (and only repealed in 1991 after a campaign by Bush Sr.) -- a resolution UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has called 'a low point' in the U.N.'s history.   Given its blatant anti-Semitism, the U.N. should remove from its entrance the famous phrase that ostensibly defines its mission: 'They shall beat their swords into plowshares, their spears into pruning hooks. Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.' This, after all, is a quote from Isaiah.  For another example, see the recent ICJ decision ordering Israel to tear down its security fence. In the last four months two Israelis have died in suicide attacks, compared with 166 killed in the same time frame at the height of the terror. Israel finally finds a nonviolent, changeable way to stop terrorism, and 14 judges in The Hague rule it illegal -— in an opinion read by a chief judge representing China, which massacred hundreds of its own citizens who were demonstrating peacefully in Tiananmen Square. In the decision, the word 'terrorism' appears not once (except when citing Israeli claims).  The decision is based on the phony pretext that the 1949 cease-fire line is in fact Israel's boundary. That has yet to be determined. The Palestinians -- who claim all of Israel -- have never accepted that boundary. But based on that, the court declared itself “not convinced” that Israel needs this barrier for its security. It said the fence violates Palestinian “humanitarian” rights such as “the right to work, to health, to education and to an adequate standard of living as proclaimed in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.”  What about Israelis' right not to get blown to smithereens while riding the bus to work? What about the rights of Isreali Palestinians, who are as often victims of these bombers?  As a U.S. newspaper columnist (Charles Krauthammer) wrote this week, 'Yes, the fence causes some hardship to Palestinians. Some are separated from their fields, some schoolchildren have to walk much farther to class. This is unfortunate. On any scale of human decency, however, it is far more unfortunate that 1,000 Israelis are dead from Palestinian terrorism, and thousands more horribly maimed, including Israeli schoolchildren with nails and bolts and shrapnel lodged in their brains and spines who will never be walking to school again.'  Even if it had not been hijacked by anti-Semites and anti-Americans, and even if it were not hopelessly corrupt (the pre-war Iraq food-for-oil bribery scandal is a great example), The U.N., like the Geneva Conventions, is simply out of date. It is set up to deal with problems that have changed and mutated, while the organization itself has not.  Its charter is meant to regulate a world of nation-states. International relations generally now stabilized throughout much of the world. The U.N. could still perform some useful role and exercise some authority -- as it did in East Timor -- in places where they are not (such as the recent wars in West Africa), if it had the balls to actually get up off its ass and claim that authority.  But nothing in the U.N. charter allows it to get involved in inter-national crises without an invitation. And the current leadership of the U.N. clearly has no stomach for that sort of work. So Saddam butchers the Kurds and the Shiites and nobody at the U.N. lifts a finger. Yet these kinds of dlaughter are what causes the most suffering in the world today. Neither does the U.N. have any mechanism to deal with extra-state forces like international terror. Yet these, not nation-state wars, are driving the current crisis in the world, and I am willing to bet they will remain the fountains of global violence for the rest of my lifetime and yours.

         "          [You say] the UN is a useless club for other countries (dictators?) to lecture the US and accomplish nothing; also, the UN is not the same as the world (from another of your messages): The UN is an assembly of representatives of the world's governments. I may be wrong, but, as a result of the expansion of democracy in the last 2 decades, the UN has now a large majority of democratically elected governments. In this sense, it represents the world's will (in the same way that the US Congress represents the will of the American people).  Now, if this is true, how can one say that its debates are useless? And how can one consign it to oblivion simply because it doesn't happen to assent to one's wishes?    According to Freedom House, 'electoral democracies constitute 120 of the 192 internationally recognized independent polities.' But to say that the U.N. represents 'the world's will' in the way that Congress represents the American people's will is false. The U.S. people directly elect their Congress. A little under two-thirds of the people in the U.N. elect their leaders. Those leaders then  appoint  representatives to the U.N. And the U.N.'s work is often done at the level of committees which are elected from among the representatives. So the relation that the U.N. bears to the people of the world is more like that of a U.S. Senate subcommittee. And those can be pretty far off base.  The UN has noble ideals, but a rotten reality. Consider the outrageous decision, on the eve of the Iraq war, to name a delegate from Libya to head the UN Human Rights Commission (UNHRC). Thirty-three of the UNHRC's 53-member nations voted in favour of Libya and 17 abstained, even though Libya is still under UN sanctions for supporting international terrorism. This is the conscience of the world community? Ghadafi's regime, which the U.N. itself has accused of summary executions and systematic use of torture, should sit in judgment of Denmark and Japan and Singapore?  Instead, the U.N. General Assembly has been obsessed with condemning the Jewish state -- along with Turkey, the sole real democracy, till now, in the entire festering Middle East. Driven by its Arab bloc, supported by Third World dictatorships, and with the increasing support of EU nations currying favor with the Arabs, the U.N. has passed more resolutions condemning Israel than any other nation on Earth, while excusing Palestinian terrorism and ignoring the catastrophic human rights violations of Israel's regional enemies.   The UNHRC especially has a history of singling out Israel and recently all but endorsed terrorism against its civilians through a resolution supporting 'armed struggle ... by all available means.' But it was at the infamous World Conference Against Racism in Durban in 2001 where the years of festering U.N. anti-Semitism flowed out in public in raw displays of anti-Semitism, including intimidation, harassment and hate-filled speeches. The conference was hijacked by those whose only interest was to bash Israel at what was supposed to be a forum against world racism.  Attempts even were made to revive the infamous 'Zionism is racism' resolution passed by the General Assembly in 1975 (and only repealed in 1991 after a campaign by Bush Sr.) -- a resolution UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has called 'a low point' in the U.N.'s history.   Given its blatant anti-Semitism, the U.N. should remove from its entrance the famous phrase that ostensibly defines its mission: 'They shall beat their swords into plowshares, their spears into pruning hooks. Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.' This, after all, is a quote from Isaiah.  For another example, see the recent ICJ decision ordering Israel to tear down its security fence. In the last four months two Israelis have died in suicide attacks, compared with 166 killed in the same time frame at the height of the terror. Israel finally finds a nonviolent, changeable way to stop terrorism, and 14 judges in The Hague rule it illegal -— in an opinion read by a chief judge representing China, which massacred hundreds of its own citizens who were demonstrating peacefully in Tiananmen Square. In the decision, the word 'terrorism' appears not once (except when citing Israeli claims).  The decision is based on the phony pretext that the 1949 cease-fire line is in fact Israel's boundary. That has yet to be determined. The Palestinians -- who claim all of Israel -- have never accepted that boundary. But based on that, the court declared itself “not convinced” that Israel needs this barrier for its security. It said the fence violates Palestinian “humanitarian” rights such as “the right to work, to health, to education and to an adequate standard of living as proclaimed in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.”  What about Israelis' right not to get blown to smithereens while riding the bus to work? What about the rights of Isreali Palestinians, who are as often victims of these bombers?  As a U.S. newspaper columnist (Charles Krauthammer) wrote this week, 'Yes, the fence causes some hardship to Palestinians. Some are separated from their fields, some schoolchildren have to walk much farther to class. This is unfortunate. On any scale of human decency, however, it is far more unfortunate that 1,000 Israelis are dead from Palestinian terrorism, and thousands more horribly maimed, including Israeli schoolchildren with nails and bolts and shrapnel lodged in their brains and spines who will never be walking to school again.'  Even if it had not been hijacked by anti-Semites and anti-Americans, and even if it were not hopelessly corrupt (the pre-war Iraq food-for-oil bribery scandal is a great example), The U.N., like the Geneva Conventions, is simply out of date. It is set up to deal with problems that have changed and mutated, while the organization itself has not.  Its charter is meant to regulate a world of nation-states. International relations generally now stabilized throughout much of the world. The U.N. could still perform some useful role and exercise some authority -- as it did in East Timor -- in places where they are not (such as the recent wars in West Africa), if it had the balls to actually get up off its ass and claim that authority.  But nothing in the U.N. charter allows it to get involved in inter-national crises without an invitation. And the current leadership of the U.N. clearly has no stomach for that sort of work. So Saddam butchers the Kurds and the Shiites and nobody at the U.N. lifts a finger. Yet these kinds of dlaughter are what causes the most suffering in the world today. Neither does the U.N. have any mechanism to deal with extra-state forces like international terror. Yet these, not nation-state wars, are driving the current crisis in the world, and I am willing to bet they will remain the fountains of global violence for the rest of my lifetime and yours.

everything you don't want to know about how publishing really works Editor's note Although the author's name and some identifying details have been changed the facts quotes e-mails and tragedy depicted in this story are real By Jane Austen Doe March A midlist author is one whose books are well received but have failed to make a commercial breakthrough whose work sells solidly but unspectacularly who's well known within the writing community but the majority of book buyers have never heard his name David Armstrong How Not to Write a Novel Confessions of a Midlist Author Reader Advisory By the end of this story I will have broken the most sacred rules of modern authordom I'll tell you how much my publishers have paid me for the books I've written I'll tell you how many copies each of those books has sold I'll share with you some of the secrets lies and euphemisms told to me by my publishers editors publicists and agents in their efforts to comfort pacify and motivate me and I'll share some of the salient facts that make those secrets lies and euphemisms such common industry currency If you don't want to hear about the noir underside of publishing if you're a writer longing for a literary career or a reader who's happier not knowing that producing and marketing a book these days involves about as much moral purity as producing and marketing a pair of Nikes I suggest you stop reading now Still with me Great But who exactly might I be I'm not saying Because although I've published books and articles about things most people won't talk about let alone publish my sex life and marriage counseling my quirky predilections and unpopular politics my worst mistakes and no-longer-secret yearnings I'm using a pseudonym to write this story because telling the truth about my life as a writer is one risk I can't afford to take Thinking you'll put the clues together figure out who I am Give it your best shot If you could identify me based on the story I'm about to tell you I wouldn't have it to tell Here's a Clue You might know me by my number That's today's sales ranking of my latest book on Amazon Sadly this is also how I rate myself Not bad not nearly good enough Interlude A Midlist Author Friend Writes Tales of the midlist author When my latest book came out a few weeks ago it bounced around the Amazon rankings in the to range supported there by the radio shows I'm doing and my buddy who runs a Web bulletin board Then last Thursday I mailed a piece promotion to my personal list pitching Amazon that's selling the book for percent off list This morning my latest book is No Now we all know that the Amazon rankings are a distorted mirror and can't be taken too too seriously On the other hand they're the only instant sales data midlist authors have So I'm encouraged My mailing to members of the organization presumably interested in my latest book goes out this weekend Fingers crossed that I see at least one day in three figures The Story Being the author of several critically acclaimed moderately successful books has given me an extraordinary exciting occasionally lucrative quite public life It has also broken my heart Nothing makes me happier than writing And thanks to the rules that govern publishing today nothing I've ever done for a living housecleaning data entry creating campaigns for big-name cutthroat ad agencies full-time motherhood has been as hard on me as being a writer Being an author is the culmination of a lifelong dream And because the sales of each book I write determine my ability to remain one being an author has ruined many of my greatest lifelong pleasures Reading a book that's poorly written I pace the floor beseeching the Muses God and the editors of Publishers Weekly to explain why trash like this sells so much better than serious books like mine Reading a book that's well written I writhe instead with envy Relax with a glossy magazine on a sun-splashed beach Not me not anymore The magazine doesn't exist that hasn't either published or rejected my work and there's a trail of tears behind every story Sunday morning in bed with a steaming cup of French roast a well-schmeared bagel the book review section of the New York Times Sounds great if only I could sip chew and gnash my teeth all at once Veg out in front of the tube Impossible Playboy is nearly the only channel that hasn't scheduled then cancelled me each booking raising hopes of thousands of copies sold each cancellation a stake driven through the heart of my career Never an enthusiastic employee I quit my job at age to become a full-time writer to live life on my own terms After publishing four books each of them critically acclaimed several of them award-winners none of them big enough sellers to ensure my next book contract let alone the lifetime of book contracts I crave I feel less in control of my finances my schedule my priorities and my well-being than I did when I had bosses and employees to answer to Acknowledgment Of Good Fortune Believe me I know I'm lucky to be published at all I've read enough talented unpublished writers to realize just how arbitrary that privilege is I'm more fortunate still to have had publishers who made significant investments in my books editors who have gone to the mat for me an agent I admire and trust For more than a decade
